		<h2>THE OUTGOING OF SIMEON</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Elizabeth Duer</p>
	</div>

	<div class="leftcol">
		<img class="illocap" src="images/cap1.png" width="118" height="117" alt="S" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Simeon Ponsonby</span>—the
		professor of botany
		at Harmouth—had
		married
		when over forty
		the eldest daughter
		of a distinguished though impecunious
		family in his own college
		town. His mother, on her
		deathbed, foresaw that he would
		need a housekeeper and suggested
		the match.</p>

		<p>“Simeon,” she said, “it isn’t for
		us to question the Lord’s ways,
		but I am mortally sorry to leave
		you, my son; it is hard for a man
		to shift for himself. I was thinking
		now if you were to marry
		Deena Shelton you might go right along
		in the old house. The Sheltons would
		be glad to have her off their hands,
		and she is used to plain living. She
		would know enough to keep her soup
		pot always simmering on the back of
		the range and make her preserves with
		half the regular quantity of sugar. I
		like her because she brushes her hair
		and parts it in the middle, and she has
		worn the same best dress for three
		years.”</p>
	</div>

	<div class="rightcol">
		<p>Soon after Mrs. Ponsonby died and
		Simeon married Deena.</p>

		<p>She didn’t particularly want to marry
		him, but then, on the other hand,
		she was not violently set against
		it. She saw romance through her
		mother’s eyes, and Mrs. Shelton
		said Professor Ponsonby was a
		man any girl might be proud to
		win. If his sympathies were as
		narrow as his shoulders, his scientific
		reputation extended over the
		civilized world, and Harmouth
		was proud of the fact. Deena’s
		attention was not called to his
		sympathies, and it was called to
		his reputation.</p>

		<p>He proposed to Miss Shelton
		in a few well-chosen words, placed
		his mother’s old-fashioned diamond
		ring on her finger, and
		urged forward the preparations
		for the wedding with an impatience
		that bespoke an ardent disposition.
		Later Deena learned that his one
		servant had grown reckless in joints
		after Mrs. Ponsonby’s death, and the
		house bills had shocked Simeon into
		seeking immediate aid.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="clear"> </div>

	<p>At twenty Deena was able to accommodate
	herself to her new life with
	something more than resignation; a
	wider experience would have made it
	intolerable. She was flattered by his
	selection, proud to have a house of her
	own, and not sorry to be freed from the
	burdens of her own home. There were
	no little Ponsonbys, and there had been
	five younger Sheltons, all clamoring for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>Deena’s love and care, whereas Simeon
	made no claims except that she
	should stay at home and care for the
	house and not exceed her allowance.
	If she expected to see a great deal of
	her own family she was mistaken, for,
	while no words passed on the subject,
	she felt that visiting was to be discouraged
	and the power to invite was vested
	in Simeon alone. Respect was the keynote
	of her attitude in regard to him,
	and he made little effort to bridge the
	chasm of years between them.</p>

	<p>He was a tall, spare man, slightly
	stooped, with a prominent forehead,
	insignificant nose, and eyes red and
	strained through too ardent a use of the
	microscope. He habitually wore gold-rimmed
	spectacles; indeed, he put them
	on in the morning before he tied his
	cravat, and took them off at the corresponding
	moment of undressing at
	night. His mouth was his best feature,
	for, while the lips were pinched, they
	had a kind of cold refinement.</p>

	<p>He was a just man but close, and the
	stipend he gave his wife for their
	monthly expenses barely kept them in
	comfort, but Deena had been brought
	up in the school of adversity, and had
	few personal needs. Her house absorbed
	all her interest, as well as stray
	pennies. The old mahogany furniture
	was polished till it shone; the Ponsonby
	silver tea set looked as bright as if
	no battering years lay between it and
	its maker’s hand a century ago; the
	curtains were always clean; the flowers
	seemed to grow by magic—and Deena
	still parted her wonderful bronze hair
	and kept it sleek.</p>

	<p>At the end of two years, when she
	was twenty-two, a ripple of excitement
	came into her life; another Shelton girl
	married, and caused even greater relief
	to her family than had Deena, for she
	married a Boston man with money. He
	had been a student at Harmouth and
	had fallen in love with Polly Shelton’s
	violet eyes and strange red-gold hair,
	that seemed the only gold fate had bestowed
	upon the Sheltons. He took
	Polly to Boston, where, as young Mrs.
	Benjamin Minthrop, she became the
	belle of the season, and almost a professional
	beauty, though she couldn’t
	hold a candle to Deena—Deena whose
	adornment was “a meek and quiet spirit,”
	who obeyed Simeon with the subjection
	St. Peter recommended—whose
	conversation was “chaste coupled with
	fear.”</p>

	<p>But one day all this admirable monotony
	came to an end quite adventitiously,
	and events came treading on each other’s
	heels. It was a crisp October day,
	and an automobile ran tooting and
	snorting, and trailing its vile smells,
	through Harmouth till it stopped at
	Professor Ponsonby’s gate and a lady
	got out and ran up the courtyard path.
	Deena had been trying in vain to make
	quince jelly stiffen—<em>jell</em> was the word
	used in the receipt book of the late
	Mrs. Ponsonby—with the modicum of
	sugar prescribed, till in despair she had
	resorted to a pinch of gelatine, and felt
	that the shade of her mother-in-law
	was ticking the word <em>incompetent</em> from
	the clock in the hall—when suddenly
	the watchword was drowned in the
	stertorous breathing of the machine at
	the gate, and Polly whisked in without
	ringing and met Deena face to face.</p>

	<p>“We have come to take you for a
	spin in our new automobile,” Polly
	cried, gayly. “Where is Simeon? You
	think he would not care to go? Well,
	leave him for once, and come as far as
	Wolfshead, and we will lunch there
	and bring you back before sunset.”</p>

	<p>Deena’s delicate complexion was reddened
	by the heat of the preserve kettle,
	her sleeves were rolled above her elbows,
	and a checked apron with a bib
	acted as overalls. Polly twitched her
	to the stairs.</p>

	<p>“What a fright you make of yourself,”
	she exclaimed; “and yet, I declare,
	you are pretty, in spite of it!
	Ben has to go down in the town to get
	some more gasoline, and then he means
	to persuade Stephen French to go with
	us, so rush upstairs and change your
	dress while I report to him that you will
	go, and he will come back for us in
	half an hour.”</p>

	<p>Stephen French, who was to make
	the fourth in the automobile, was Harmouth’s
	young professor of zoölogy,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>a favorite alike with the students and
	the dons, with the social element in the
	town as well as the academic. To Ben
	Minthrop he had been a saving grace
	during a rather dissipated career at college,
	and now that that young gentleman
	was married, and his feet set in
	the path of commercial respectability,
	the friendship was even more cemented.
	On Ben’s part there was admiration
	and gratitude, on Stephen’s the genuine
	liking an older man has for a
	youngster who has had the pluck to pull
	himself together. It was a bond between
	the Shelton sisters that their husbands
	shared one sentiment in common—namely,
	a romantic affection for Stephen
	French.</p>

	<p>Deena was standing in her petticoat
	when her sister joined her in her bed-room—not
	in a petticoat of lace and
	needlework, such as peeped from under
	the edge of Polly’s smart frock as she
	threw herself into a chair, but a skimpy
	black silk skirt with a prim ruffle, made
	from an old gown of Mrs. Ponsonby’s.
	It was neat and fresh, however, and
	her neck and arms, exposed by her little
	tucked underwaist, were of a beauty
	to ravish a painter or a sculptor. Polly
	herself, boyish and angular in build,
	groaned to think of such perfection
	“born to blush unseen”; her one season
	in Boston had demonstrated to her the
	value of beauty as an asset in that
	strange, modern exchange we call society.
	She was evidently trying to say
	something that would not get itself
	said, and her elder sister was too busy
	with her toilet to notice the signs of
	perturbation. Finally the words came
	with a rush.</p>

	<p>“Deena,” she said, “when we were
	children in the nursery you once said
	I was a ‘coward <em>at</em> you’—I remember
	your very words. Well, I believe I am
	still! You are so dignified and repressing
	that I am always considering what
	you will think a liberty. I have taken
	a liberty now, but please don’t be angry.
	It does seem so absurd to be afraid to
	make a present to one’s own sister.”</p>

	<p>She opened the bedroom door, and
	dragged in a huge box, which she proceeded
	to uncord, talking all the while.</p>

	<p>“I have brought you a dress,” she
	said; “a coat and skirt made for me
	by R——, but Ben cannot bear me in
	it because it’s so womanish—pockets
	where no man would have them, and
	the sleeves all trimmed—and so, as I
	think it charming myself, I hoped, perhaps,
	you would accept it.”</p>

	<p>Both sisters blushed, Polly with shyness,
	Deena with genuine delight. She
	loved pretty things, although she rarely
	yielded to their temptations, and she
	kissed her sister in loving acknowledgment
	of the gift. It never occurred
	to her that Simeon could object.</p>

	<p>Polly, in high spirits at her success,
	next declared that she must arrange
	Deena’s hair, and she pushed her into a
	low chair in front of the dressing table,
	and fluffed the golden mane high above
	the temples, and coiled and pinned it
	into waves and curls that caught the
	sunlight on their silken sheen and gave
	it back. A very beautiful young woman
	was reflected in old Mother Ponsonby’s
	small looking-glass, a face of character
	and spirit, in spite of its regularity.</p>

	<p>“There, admire yourself!” exclaimed
	Polly, thrusting a hand mirror into her
	sister’s grasp. “I don’t believe you
	ever look at your profile or the back of
	your head! You are so busy enacting
	the part of your own mother-in-law
	that I only wonder you don’t insist upon
	wearing widow’s caps. Oh! I beg
	your pardon—I forgot that could only
	be done by forfeiting Simeon! Where
	do you keep your shirt-waists? This
	one isn’t half bad; let me help you into
	it.”</p>

	<p>She chose the least antiquated blouse
	in Deena’s wardrobe, and pinned it into
	place with the precision of experience;
	next she hooked the new skirt round
	the waist and held the little coat for her
	sister to put on.</p>

	<p>“Where is your hat?” she demanded.</p>

	<p>Deena fetched a plain black straw,
	rusty from the sun and dust of two
	summers, and shook her head as she
	tried to pinch the bows into shape.</p>

	<p>“I shall be like a peacock turned
	topsy-turvy,” she laughed—“ashamed
	of my head instead of my feet!”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>Polly took it out of her hand.</p>

	<p>“Of course, you cannot wear <em>that</em>
	with your hair done in the new way—besides,
	it spoils your whole costume.
	I saw quite a decent hat in a shop
	window in the next street. I’ll get it
	for you!” and she was out of the room
	like a flash of lightning.</p>

	<p>Deena ran to the window and caught
	her mercurial sister issuing from the
	door below.</p>

	<p>“Stop, Polly!” she called. “I cannot
	afford a new hat, and I cannot accept
	anything more—please come back.”</p>

	<p>Polly made a little grimace and
	walked steadily down the path; at the
	gate she condescended to remark:</p>

	<p>“Have all your last words said to
	your cook by the time I get back, for
	Ben will not want to wait.”</p>

	<p>In ten minutes she returned with a
	smart little hat, and in answer to
	Deena’s remonstrances, she tossed the
	condemned one into the wood fire that
	was burning on the dining-room
	hearth; at the same instant the automobile
	arrived at the gate. Deena, nearly
	in tears, pinned the unwelcome purchase
	on her head, and followed her
	sister to the street. The hat set lightly
	enough on her curls, but it weighed
	heavily on her conscience.</p>

	<p>After the manner of the amateur
	chauffeur, Ben was doubled up under
	the front wheels of his motor, offering
	a stirrup-cup of machine oil to the god
	of the car, but Stephen French stood
	at the gate, his grave face lighted up
	with the fun of a stolen holiday.</p>

	<p>“You see a truant professor!” he
	exclaimed. “Simeon doesn’t approve;
	we couldn’t induce him to come. He
	said a day off meant a night on for
	him—he is so wise, is Simeon—but I
	positively had to do something in the
	way of sport; I am in a reckless mood
	to-day.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll do the wrecking for you, if
	that’s all you want,” came from under
	the auto’s wheels.</p>

	<p>Stephen conveyed his thanks.</p>

	<p>“I dare say you will, with no effort
	on your part,” he said, opening the
	back door of the great, puffing monster.
	“Get in here, Mrs. Ponsonby. Ben
	likes his wife beside him in front, he
	says, because she understands how to
	run the machine when he blows his
	nose, but I think it is a clear case of
	belated honeymoon.”</p>

	<p>Here Ben scrambled to his feet, his
	broad, good-humored face crimson
	from groveling.</p>

	<p>“Deena, good-day to you,” he cried.
	“How perfectly stunning you look! I
	declare I thought Polly was the pick
	of the Sheltons, but, by Jove! you are
	running her hard. What have you been
	doing to yourself?”</p>

	<p>Stephen French was delighted—he
	laughed his slow, reluctant laugh, and
	then he called to Ben:</p>

	<p>“Turn round and see whether you
	dropped them in the road.”</p>

	<p>“Dropped what?” asked Ben, his
	hand on the lever, making a black semicircle.</p>

	<p>“Your manners,” said Stephen, and
	chuckled again.</p>

	<p>“You go to thunder,” roared Ben,
	shooting ahead. “A poor, wretched
	bachelor like you instructing a married
	man how to treat his sister-in-law, and
	just because once upon a time I sat
	in your lecture room and let you bore
	me by the hour about protoplasms! Do
	you suppose I should dare admit to
	Polly that Deena is as handsome as she
	is? Why, man alive, a Russian warship
	off Port Arthur would be a place
	of safety compared to this automobile.”</p>

	<p>Deena, laughing though embarrassed,
	was trying to cover the countenance
	that provoked the discussion with a
	veil, for her hat strained at its pins
	and threatened to blow back to Harmouth
	before the knotty point was settled
	as to who should pay for it.</p>

	<p>They were flying between fields
	strewn with Michaelmas daisies and
	wooded banks gay with the first kiss
	of frost, and gradually Deena forgot
	everything but the exhilaration of rushing
	through the air, and their attitude
	of holiday-making. She was thoroughly
	at her ease with French; he was
	Simeon’s one intimate in the corps of
	professors, the only creature who was
	ever welcome at the Ponsonby table,
	the one discerning soul who found
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>something to admire in Simeon’s harsh
	dealings with himself and the world.
	Their line of study naturally drew them
	together, but Stephen admired the man
	as well as the scholar; the purity of
	his scientific ambition, the patience with
	which he bore his poverty—for poverty
	seemed a serious thing to French, who
	was a man of independent fortune, and
	whose connection with the university
	was a matter of predilection only.
	With Ponsonby it was bread and butter,
	and yet he had ventured to marry with
	nothing but his splendid brain between
	his wife and absolute want. French
	stole a glance at Deena, who was looking
	more beautiful than he had ever
	seen her, and wondered whether she
	found her lot satisfactory; whether
	there were not times when Simeon’s
	absence was precious to her. Without
	disloyalty to his friend, he hoped so,
	for he had something to tell her before
	the day was over that might lead to a
	temporary separation, and he hated to
	think of those lovely eyes swimming in
	tears—all women were not Penelopes.</p>

	<p>“She can’t care in <em>that way</em>,” he reflected.
	“Ponsonby is tremendous in his
	own line, of course, but no woman
	could love him.”</p>

	<p>Perhaps he was mistaken—perhaps
	Mrs. Ponsonby loved her husband with
	all the fervor of passion, but she conveyed
	an impression of emancipation
	to-day, and of powers of enjoyment
	hitherto suppressed, that made Stephen
	doubt. She was like a child bubbling
	over with happiness, gay as a lark, as
	unlike her usual self in behavior as her
	modish appearance was unlike that of
	Simeon Ponsonby’s self-denying wife.</p>

	<p>“Of course she won’t mind; why
	should she?” he decided, and yet determined
	to put off making his announcement
	till after lunch.</p>

	<p>At Wolfshead they stopped at the little
	inn, found the one o’clock dinner
	smoking on the table, and sat down with
	the rest of the hungry company—employees
	of a branch railroad that had its
	terminus there; drummers in flashy
	shop-made clothes, and temporary residents
	in the little town. This jaunt had
	given them an appetite, and roast beef
	and apple tart disappeared at a rate that
	should have doubled their bill.</p>

	<p>After lunch they strolled down to the
	beach, Deena starting ahead with
	French, while Polly went with Ben to
	get cushions from the automobile. The
	present generation seems to consider
	comfort the first aim of existence,
	though the trouble they take to insure
	it more than counterbalances the results
	in old-fashioned judgment.</p>

	<p>Stephen stopped to light his cigar behind
	the shelter of a tree, and then came
	running after Deena, who was walking
	slowly toward the vast plain of blue water
	stretching to the east. She turned
	at the sound of his footsteps and waited
	for him, wondering what his classes
	would think if they could see their professor
	bounding along with his hat under
	his arm. There was something peculiarly
	charming in the lighter side of
	Stephen’s nature; a simplicity and boyishness,
	which was the secret of his popularity
	far more than his weightier qualities.
	The women of Harmouth called
	him handsome, but he had small claims
	to beauty. A well set-up figure rather
	above the medium height, dark hair
	grizzled at the temples, eyes that seemed
	to laugh because of a slight contraction
	of the muscles at the outer corners, and
	a nose decidedly too high and bony.
	The expression of the mouth was
	shrewd, almost sarcastic, and possibly
	a little coarse, but his smile redeemed
	it and illumined his face like sunshine.
	What dazzled the ladies of Harmouth
	was really a certain easy luxury in dress
	and habits not common in the little
	town. It is always the exotic we prize
	in our conservatories.</p>

	<p>This summing up of French’s outer
	man was not Deena’s estimate, as she
	watched his approach—she was too familiar
	with his appearance to receive
	any especial impression. She accepted
	his apologies for his cigar and for keeping
	her waiting with an indifferent air,
	and turned once more toward the sea.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="two">II</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>The beach at Wolfshead was pebbly,
	with rocks thrown untidily about and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>ridges of blackened seaweed marking
	the various encroachments of the tide.
	Stephen brushed the top of a low bowlder
	with his handkerchief and invited
	Deena to sit down.</p>

	<p>“You would be more comfortable,”
	he said, “if Ben would come with the
	cushions.”</p>

	<p>“I am quite comfortable without
	them,” she answered, “though I cannot
	but resent the Paul and Virginia attitude
	of the young Minthrops. One
	would think a year of married life
	would have satisfied their greed for
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</em>. I wonder whether they
	would continue sufficient to each other
	if they really were stranded on a desert
	island.”</p>

	<p>“Could you be happy on such an island
	with the man of your heart, Mrs.
	Ponsonby?” asked Stephen.</p>

	<p>And Deena, feeling that Simeon was
	perforce the man of her heart, and that
	he was quite unfitted to live on sea
	air and love, answered, smiling:</p>

	<p>“Not unless there were a perfectly
	new flora to keep him contented.”</p>

	<p>Stephen saw his opportunity to make
	his communication, and said, quickly:</p>

	<p>“I suspect you have been reading
	those articles of Simeon’s in the <cite>Scientist</cite>
	on the vegetation of Tierra del
	Fuego. They are very able. He ought
	to go there and verify all he has gleaned
	by his reading. We fully appreciate we
	have a remarkable man at Harmouth in
	our professor of botany.”</p>

	<p>Deena colored with pleasure.</p>

	<p>“Poor Simeon,” she said; “his limited
	means have stood in the way of such
	personal research, and then, also, the
	college holidays are too short for extended
	trips.”</p>

	<p>“Let him throw over his classes in
	the cause of science,” said Stephen,
	with excitement. “Why, such a book
	as Simeon would write after an exploration
	of—Fuegia, let us say—would
	place him among the scientists of the
	world.”</p>

	<p>The thought that raced across
	Deena’s mind was what dull reading it
	would be, but she recognized the impropriety
	of the reflection and said,
	simply:</p>

	<p>“It is too bad we haven’t a little more
	money.”</p>

	<p>Stephen put his hand in his breast
	pocket and half drew out a letter, and
	then let it drop back, and then he
	walked a little apart from Deena and
	looked at her thoughtfully, as if trying
	to readjust his previous ideas of her
	to the present coquetry of her appearance.
	The way her thoughts had flown
	to Simeon when a desert island existence
	was mooted seemed as if she did
	care, and Stephen hated to give pain,
	and yet the letter had to be answered,
	and the opportunity was not likely to
	occur again. The thing he had always
	admired most in his friend’s wife was
	her common sense—to that he trusted.</p>

	<p>“Mrs. Ponsonby,” he said, boldly, “if
	Simeon had a chance to do this very
	thing—free of expense—would you be
	unhappy at his desertion? Would you
	feel that the man who sent him to Patagonia
	was doing you an unkindness
	you could not forgive?”</p>

	<p>“I should rejoice at his good fortune,”
	she answered, calmly. “The fact
	that I should miss him would not weigh
	with me for a moment.”</p>

	<p>French gave a sigh of relief, while
	his imagination pictured to him a dissolving
	view of Polly under similar circumstances.</p>

	<p>“The Argentine Government is fitting
	up an expedition,” he went on, “to
	go through the Straits of Magellan and
	down the east coast of Fuegia with a
	view of finding out something more exact
	in regard to the mineral and agricultural
	resources than has been known
	hitherto. I happen to have been in active
	correspondence for some time with
	the man who virtually set the thing going,
	and he has asked me to send him
	a botanist from here. Shall I offer the
	chance to your husband? He must go
	at once. It is already spring in that
	part of the world, and the summer at
	Cape Horn is short.”</p>

	<p>Deena’s face grew crimson and then
	paled. She felt an emotion she could
	not believe—pure, unalloyed joy! But
	in a second she understood better; it
	was joy, of course, but joy at Simeon’s
	good luck.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>“Could he get leave of absence right
	in the beginning of the term?” she
	asked, breathlessly.</p>

	<p>And Stephen answered that he had
	never taken his Sabbatical year, and that
	some one could be found to do his work,
	though it might mean forfeiting half his
	salary.</p>

	<p>Here they were joined by Polly and
	Ben, and as Deena made no reference
	to the subject they had been discussing,
	the talk wandered to general topics.</p>

	<p>The sun was making long shadows
	and the hour to start was come. The
	gayety of the morning deserted Deena
	as they sped back to Harmouth. Her
	brain was busy fitting her ideas to this
	possible change that French had just
	foreshadowed, and though she was silent,
	her eyes shone with excitement
	and her color came and went in response
	to her unspoken thoughts.</p>

	<p>In her mind she saw Tierra del
	Fuego as it looked on the map at the
	end of the narrowing continent, and
	then she remembered a picture of Cape
	Horn that had been in her geography
	when she was a child—a bold, rocky
	promontory jutting into a restless sea,
	in which three whales were blowing
	fountains from the tops of their heads.
	She reflected that it was very far away,
	and that in going there Simeon might
	encounter possible dangers and certain
	discomfort, and she tried to feel sorry,
	and all the time a wild excitement
	blazed in her breast. She felt as if her
	youth had been atrophied, and that if
	Simeon went it might revive, and then
	a great shame shook her to have allowed
	such thoughts, and a tender pity for
	the lonely man she had married obliterated
	self.</p>

	<p>Stephen’s voice broke in upon her
	reverie.</p>

	<p>“Have I depressed you, Mrs. Ponsonby?”</p>

	<p>“No, no,” she answered. “I am only
	considering ways and means. I want
	him to go. We might rent our house
	for the winter, and I could go home to
	live. Count upon my doing everything
	in my power to make Simeon’s going
	easy, Mr. French.”</p>

	<p>“You are admirable,” said Stephen,
	with genuine satisfaction. He even half
	put out his hand to give hers a grasp
	of approbation, but thought better of it.
	If she had had her hair parted in the
	middle, and had been mending Ponsonby’s
	stockings under the drop-light in
	her parlor, he might have done so, braving
	the needle’s point; but, looking as
	she did to-day, it seemed safer to refrain.</p>

	<p>It was six o’clock when the auto
	stopped at Deena’s door.</p>

	<p>“I wish she had shown a little more
	emotion at his going,” was Stephen’s
	reflection as he helped her out, forgetting
	how he had dreaded any evidence
	of distress; but he only said:</p>

	<p>“May I come back to tea, Mrs. Ponsonby?
	I should like to talk this over
	with Simeon to-night.”</p>

	<p>She acquiesced with an inward misgiving;
	it was the first time, she had ever
	given an invitation to her own table,
	but it was her husband’s friend, and
	she was still excited. As she exchanged
	good-bys with her sister and Ben, Polly
	suddenly remembered to tell her something
	quite unimportant.</p>

	<p>“Oh, Deena!” she whispered, bending
	over the side of the automobile,
	“when I came to pay for your hat today,
	I found I hadn’t enough money,
	and I knew you wouldn’t like me to explain
	the circumstances to Ben, so I told
	them to send the bill to you and we will
	settle it later.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll settle it!” said Deena. She was
	a proud woman, and hated favors that
	savored of cash. “Good-night—I am
	afraid you will be late in getting to
	Newbury Hill for your dinner.”</p>

	<p>“All aboard, French!” shouted Ben—and
	they were gone.</p>

	<p>Deena stood for a moment and
	watched the retreating machine before
	she followed the path to the front door.
	A great deal that was pleasant was disappearing
	with its puffs—Ben’s gay
	spirits and Polly’s ready sympathy,
	which, if superficial, was very soothing—and
	the money power that made them
	what they were, which, in fact, permitted
	the auto to exist for them at all.
	It had all come into Deena’s life for a
	few brief hours, and was gone, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>something remained—something that
	had not been there when she got up that
	morning: the knowledge that she was
	a very beautiful woman, and more than
	a suspicion that a crisis was impending
	in her life.</p>

	<p>As she turned to face the house the
	remembrance of the unpaid hat bill laid
	a cold clutch on her heart. Until the
	first of next month she had exactly ten
	dollars at her credit, and that was Simeon’s—not
	hers—given to her for a specific
	purpose. She determined to throw
	herself upon his indulgence, confess her
	weakness and beg him to pay the bill for
	her. She had never before asked a personal
	favor of him, but was she justified
	in doubting his kindness, because of her
	own shyness and pride in concealing her
	needs? She almost persuaded herself
	he would be gratified at her request.
	After all, Simeon was not an anchorite;
	he had his moods like other men, and
	there were times when a rough passion
	marked his dealings with his wife; perhaps
	he had not been very felicitous in
	his rôle of lover, but the remembrance
	that there was such a side to his nature
	gave a fillip to her courage.</p>

	<p>For the first time he would see her
	at her best; might not her prettiness—bah!
	the thought disgusted her! That
	she, a typical, housewifely, modest New
	England woman should be calculating
	on her beauty to draw money from a
	man’s pocket, even though that man
	were her husband, seemed to her immoral.
	She would plainly and directly
	ask him to pay the money, and there
	was the end of it. She opened the front
	door and went in.</p>

	<p>The Ponsonby house was two stories
	high, built of wood and set a little back
	from the street, with flower beds bordering
	the path to the gate and neat
	grass plots on either side. Within, a
	small parlor and dining room on the
	right of the hall, and to the left a spacious
	study; behind that was the kitchen.</p>

	<p>The door of the study was half open,
	and Simeon sat at his desk reading
	proof; one of his many contributions to
	a scientific periodical, and, judging by
	the pile of galley sheets, an important article.
	He had a way of pursing his lips
	and glaring through his spectacles when
	he read that gave him a look of preternatural
	wisdom. He was never what
	Deena’s cook called “a pretty man.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Ponsonby’s slim figure slid
	through the opening without pushing
	the door wide, and spoke with a kind
	of reckless gayety.</p>

	<p>“Good-evening, Simeon,” she said,
	making a little courtesy; “you see, I
	have returned safely, ‘clothed and in my
	right mind.’”</p>

	<p>He made a marginal note of cabalistic
	import before he swung round in his
	chair and looked at her over his spectacles.</p>

	<p>“Hardly in your right mind, I should
	think,” he said, coldly.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you like me in my new
	clothes?” she asked, twirling slowly
	round to give him the entire effect of
	her costume.</p>

	<p>He was apt to be irritable when disturbed
	at his work, and Deena had not
	attached much importance to his speech.</p>

	<p>“I think,” he said, curtly, “you look
	like a woman on a poster, and not a
	reputable woman at that.”</p>

	<p>“That is hardly a nice thing to say
	of one’s wife——” she began, when he
	interrupted her.</p>

	<p>“Look here, Deena, I have work to
	do before tea, and the discussion of
	your appearance is hardly important
	enough to keep publishers waiting.
	Oblige me by taking off that dress before
	I see you again. Where did you
	get it—if I may ask?”</p>

	<p>“Polly gave it to me,” she answered,
	and was astonished to find a lump in her
	throat, a sudden desire to burst into
	tears.</p>

	<p>“Then Polly was guilty of an impertinence
	you should have resented instead
	of accepting. Ben Minthrop’s
	money may dress his own wife, but not
	mine. Let it go for this time, but never
	again subject me to such an indignity.”</p>

	<p>“But she didn’t give me the hat, Simeon,”
	said poor Deena, who knew it
	was now or never.</p>

	<p>“And who furnished you with the
	hat?” he asked, insultingly.</p>

	<p>“I meant to ask you to,” she said, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>a tear escaped and splashed on the lapel
	of her new coat, “but never mind, I will
	find some means to pay for it myself.”
	And she moved toward the door,
	wounded pride expressed in every line
	of her retreating figure.</p>

	<p>“Come back, if you please,” he called.
	“This is childish folly. How can you
	pay when you have no money except
	what I give you? I am responsible for
	your debts, and as you have taken advantage
	of that fact, I have no choice
	but to pay. This must never occur
	again. How much is it?”</p>

	<p>“I—I don’t know,” faltered Deena,
	struggling with her emotion.</p>

	<p>“You don’t know? You buy without
	even asking the price?” he pursued.</p>

	<p>The enormity of the offense crushed
	his irritation; it struck at the very
	foundations of his trust in Deena’s
	judgment, at her whole future usefulness
	to him; he almost felt as if his
	bank account were not in his own keeping.</p>

	<p>She tried to answer, but no words
	would come; explanations were beyond
	her powers, and she left the room, shutting
	the door behind her. A passion of
	tears would have made the situation
	bearable, but when you are the lady of
	the house and unexpected company is
	coming to tea, and you have but one
	servant, you have to deny yourself such
	luxuries.</p>

	<p>Deena went for a moment into the
	open air while she steadied her nerves;
	she forced herself to think what she
	could add to the evening meal, and succeeded
	in burying her mortification in
	a dish of smoked beef and eggs.</p>

	<p>Old Mrs. Ponsonby had never given
	in to late dinners, and Simeon’s digestion
	was regulated to the more economical
	plan of a light supper or tea at seven
	o’clock.</p>

	<p>Deena gave the necessary orders and
	went upstairs to her own room. One
	blessing was hers—a bedroom to herself.
	Simeon had given her his mother’s
	room and retained his own, which
	was directly in the rear. She shut the
	communicating door, and was glad she
	had done so when she heard his step in
	the passage and knew he had come to
	make the brief toilet he thought necessary
	for tea. She tore off her finery—hung
	the pretty costume in her closet,
	and, as she laid her hat on the shelf,
	registered a vow that no power on earth
	should induce her to pay for it with
	Ponsonby money. Though the clock
	pointed to ten minutes to seven, she
	shook down her hair and parted it in
	the severe style that had won its way to
	her mother-in-law’s heart. At this point
	Simeon’s door opened, and Deena remembered,
	with regret, that she had
	omitted to tell him that French was
	coming to tea. He was already halfway
	downstairs, but she came out into the
	passageway and called him. He stopped,
	gave a weary sigh, and came back.</p>

	<p>“I forgot to tell you Mr. French is
	coming to tea,” she said, quite in her
	usual tone.</p>

	<p>“Who asked him?” demanded Simeon,
	and Deena, too proud to put the responsibility
	on French, where it belonged,
	said: “I did.”</p>

	<p>Simeon was not an ill-tempered man,
	but he had had an exasperating day,
	and his wife’s conduct had offended his
	prejudices; he was not in a company
	frame of mind, and was at small pains
	to conceal his feelings; he hardly
	looked at her as he said:</p>

	<p>“I do not question your right to ask
	people to the house, but I should be
	glad to be consulted. My time is often
	precious beyond what you can appreciate,
	and I happen to be exceptionally
	busy to-night—even French will be an
	unwelcome interruption.”</p>

	<p>“I shall remember your wish,” Deena
	said, quietly, and returned to her room.</p>

	<p>A moment later she heard Stephen
	arrive, and the study door shut behind
	him.</p>

	<p>Her toilet was soon made. She knew
	every idiosyncrasy of the hooks and
	buttons of her well-worn afternoon
	frock. It was dark blue, of some clinging
	material that fell naturally into
	graceful lines, and was relieved at the
	throat and wrists by embroidered bands
	always immaculate. The damp sea
	breeze had ruffled her hair into rebellion
	against the sleekness Simeon approved,
	so that, in spite of her efforts,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>some effects of the holiday still lingered.
	Suppressed tears had made violet shadows
	under her eyes, and her mouth—sweet
	and sensitive like a child’s—drooped
	a little in recollection of her
	annoyances, but, all the same, she was
	a very beautiful young woman, whether
	sad or merry.</p>

	<p>The study door was still shut as she
	passed downstairs and into the little
	parlor. Her workbasket was standing
	by her chair, piled high with mending
	that she had neglected for her pleasuring.
	It was Saturday night, and no
	good housewife should let the duties
	of one week overlap the next. Simeon’s
	aphorism, “A day off means a
	night on,” seemed likely to be her experience
	with darning needle and patches,
	but it was a quarter past seven, and she
	deferred beginning her task till after
	tea.</p>

	<p>The servant announced the meal, and
	by Deena’s orders knocked at the study
	door, but got no response; indeed, the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de résistance</em>—the smoked beef
	and eggs—had almost hardened into a
	solid cake before the friends emerged,
	arm in arm, and followed Deena to the
	table. French drew out her chair with
	that slight exaggeration of courtesy that
	lent a charm to all he did, and with his
	hands still on the bar he bent over her
	and said—smiling the while at Simeon:</p>

	<p>“I have been telling your husband of
	what I hinted to you this afternoon,
	Mrs. Ponsonby; the expedition to Patagonia
	and his chance to join it.”</p>

	<p>Simeon’s brow contracted. It was
	disagreeable to him to have momentous
	affairs like his own discussed by anticipation
	with Deena—Deena, who was
	only a woman, and he now feared a silly
	one at that.</p>

	<p>“It is no secret, then!” said Simeon,
	contemptuously, and added, turning to
	his wife: “Be good enough not to
	speak of this before the servant; I
	should be sorry to have the faculty hear
	of such a thing from anyone but me.”</p>

	<p>She grew scarlet, but managed to
	murmur a word of acquiescence. Stephen
	looked amazed; he thought he
	must be mistaken in the rudeness of his
	friend’s manner, and then began making
	imaginary excuses for him. Of
	course, the tea table was not the place
	for confidences, and, naturally, a man
	would prefer telling such things privately
	to his wife, and the rebuke was
	meant for him, not for Mrs. Ponsonby.
	How lovely she looked—even prettier
	than in those smart clothes she had
	worn in the morning. He wondered
	whether Ponsonby knew how absolutely
	perfect she was.</p>

	<p>The servant was much in the room,
	and the talk turned on the progressive
	spirit of Argentina, its railroads, its
	great natural resources, its vast agricultural
	development. It was a dialogue
	between the men, for Simeon addressed
	himself exclusively to French—what
	could a woman know of what goes to
	make the wealth of nations!—and, as
	for Stephen, he was still uncomfortable
	from the failure of his first effort to
	bring her into the discussion.</p>

	<p>When tea was over Simeon pushed
	back his chair and was about to stalk
	from the room, when he remembered
	that French was his guest, and halted
	to let him go out first, but when French
	waited beside him to let Deena pass, an
	expression of impatience crossed her
	husband’s face, as if the precious half
	seconds he could so ill spare from his
	work, in order to reach conclusions,
	were being sacrificed to dancing master
	ceremonials.</p>

	<p>Deena sat sewing till Stephen came to
	bid her good-night.</p>

	<p>“I think it is all arranged,” he said,
	but without the joyousness of his first
	announcement. He had, perhaps, lost
	a little of his interest in his friend, Ponsonby,
	since the incident at the tea
	table.</p>

	<p>Deena, with a woman’s instinct,
	guessed at his feelings, and made no
	effort to detain him. She was tired and
	discouraged, and would gladly have
	gone to bed when their guest departed,
	except for a suspicion that Simeon
	would want to talk things over with her,
	in spite of his seeming indifference. She
	was not mistaken. In ten minutes he
	came into the parlor and threw himself
	wearily on the sofa.</p>

	<p>“Deena,” he said, and his tone was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>kind, “if I should go away for six
	months, do you think you could manage
	without me?”</p>

	<p>“I am sure I could,” she answered,
	cheerfully, “and I want to say to you,
	now that you have opened the subject,
	that you must not let my expenses stand
	in your way. I know, of course, if you
	give up your college work, part of your
	salary would naturally pass to the person
	who, for the time, undertakes your
	duties, and I have been thinking that
	a simple plan would be to rent this
	house.”</p>

	<p>The idea was not quite agreeable to
	Simeon—the old house was part of himself;
	he had been born there; his love
	for his mother overflowed into every
	rickety chair; but the common-sense
	commercial value of the scheme made
	him regard Deena with revived respect.</p>

	<p>“It is hardly practicable,” he said.
	“In the first place, it is too old-fashioned
	to attract, and, in the second,
	there is no market for furnished houses
	at Harmouth.”</p>

	<p>“Mrs. Barnes would take it, I fancy,”
	said Deena. “She is the mother of the
	student who was hurt last week in the
	football match. She is trying everywhere
	to find a furnished house so that
	she can take care of him and yet let him
	stay on here. I think we could rent it,
	Simeon, and I should need so little—so
	very little to keep me while you are
	gone.”</p>

	<p>He took off his spectacles and sat up.</p>

	<p>“It isn’t a bad idea,” he said, almost
	gayly. “The rent would pay the taxes
	and give you a small income besides,
	and leave me practically free. You have
	relieved my mind of a serious worry.
	Thank you, Deena.”</p>

	<p>“You will see the president to-morrow?”
	she asked.</p>

	<p>He hesitated before admitting that
	such was his intention; it was one thing
	for his wife to meet his difficulties with
	practical suggestions, and quite another
	for her to put intrusive questions.</p>

	<p>“You shall be informed when things
	take a definite shape,” he said, pompously.
	“Good-night, my dear; I shall
	be at work on my galley proof till daylight.”</p>

	<p>“Good-night, Simeon,” she said, gently.
	“I am sorry I displeased you today.”</p>

	<p>He mumbled something about young
	people having to make mistakes, but his
	mumble was pleasant, and then he
	crossed to her side, and kissed her forehead.</p>

	<p>She felt the pucker of his lips like
	wrinkled leather, but she told herself it
	was kind in Simeon to kiss her.</p>

	<p>As she laid her head on her pillow,
	she thought:</p>

	<p>“He never had the curiosity to ask
	what I proposed to do with myself
	when my home and husband were taken
	from me,” and the tears came at last,
	unchecked.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="three">III</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Simeon was gone—gone with his
	clothes packed in the sole leather trunk
	that his father had used before him,
	but with an equipment for botanizing as
	modern and extended as his personal
	arrangements were meager.</p>

	<p>The house was rented to Mrs. Barnes,
	the mother of the too ardent champion
	of the football field—but as her son
	was too suffering to be moved for several
	weeks to come, Deena had leisure
	to get the house in order and habituate
	herself to the idea of being homeless.</p>

	<p>Simeon behaved liberally in money
	matters; that is, he arranged that the
	rent should be paid to his wife, and he
	gave her a power of attorney which was
	to make her free of his bank account
	should anything delay his return beyond
	her resources. At the same time the
	injunctions against spending were so
	solemn that she understood she was to
	regard her control of his money as a
	mere formality—a peradventure—made
	as one makes his will, anticipating the
	unlikely.</p>

	<p>The faculty made no objection to
	Simeon’s going; indeed, his researches
	were thought likely to redound to the
	high scientific reputation that Harmouth
	particularly cherished, and Stephen
	French had taken care to foster this
	impression.</p>

	<p>The day he left was sharp for October;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>a wood fire crackled on the
	hearth in the dining room, and Deena,
	pale and calm, sat behind the breakfast
	service and made his coffee for the last
	time in many months. He ate and
	drank, and filled in the moments with
	the Harmouth <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, and his
	wife’s natural courtesy forbade her interrupting
	him. Without a word he
	stretched his arm across the table with
	his cup to have it refilled, and Deena,
	feeling her insignificance as compared
	with the morning news, still dared not
	speak. When finally he pushed back
	his chair, the little carryall was at the
	door waiting to take him and his luggage
	to the train.</p>

	<p>“You will write from New York,
	Simeon, and again by the pilot,” she
	urged, following him into the hall.
	“And where is your first port—Rio?
	Then from Rio, and as often as you
	can.”</p>

	<p>He was stuffing the pockets of his
	overcoat with papers and pamphlets, but
	he nodded assent.</p>

	<p>She came a step nearer and laid her
	hand on his arm.</p>

	<p>“Be sure <em>I</em> shall try to do as you
	would wish,” she half whispered, and
	there were tears in her eyes.</p>

	<p>“To be sure, to be sure,” said Simeon,
	with a kind of embarrassment.
	“Oh, yes, <em>I</em> shall write frequently—if
	not to you, to French, who will keep
	you informed. Don’t forget to make
	your weekly contribution to your mother’s
	housekeeping. <em>I</em> cannot allow you
	to be a burden on them during my absence;
	and consult Stephen whenever
	you are in doubt. Good-by, Deena—I
	am sorry to leave you.”</p>

	<p>He puckered his lips into the hard
	wrinkles that made his kisses so discreet,
	and gave her a parting embrace.
	She stood at the open door watching
	the distribution of his luggage, which
	he superintended with anxious care, and
	then he stepped into the one free seat
	reserved for him, and the driver
	squeezed himself between a trunk and
	roll of rugs, and they were off.</p>

	<p>Simeon waved his hand, and even
	leaned far out from the carriage window
	and smiled pleasantly, and Deena
	wiped her eyes, and began the awful
	work of making an old house, bristling
	with the characteristic accumulations of
	several generations, impersonal enough
	to rent. She had plenty to do to keep
	her loneliness in abeyance, but in the
	back of her consciousness there was a
	feeling that she had no abiding place.
	Her family had urged her to marry
	Simeon, and he was now throwing her
	back upon her family, and her dignity
	was hurt.</p>

	<p>At sunset Stephen came to see how
	she was getting on, and they had a cup
	of tea beside the dining-room fire, and
	talked about the voyage and the ports
	Simeon would touch at; and Stephen,
	who had the power of visualizing the
	descriptions he met with in his reading,
	made her see his word-painted pictures
	so clearly that she exclaimed:</p>

	<p>“When were you in South America,
	Mr. French?” and he laughed and declared
	himself a fraud.</p>

	<p>They talked on till the firelight
	alone challenged the darkness, and then
	French remembered he was dining out,
	and left her with an imagination aglow
	with all the wonders Simeon was to see.
	Lest she should be lonely, he undid a
	roll of papers, and took out several new
	magazines which he said would keep
	her amused till bedtime, and somehow
	he put new courage into her heart.</p>

	<p>Presently she went into the study and
	lit the Welsbach over the table, and
	curled herself up in Simeon’s great
	chair to enjoy her periodicals, and then
	her eye fell upon a parcel of proof, directed
	but not sent, and she read the address,
	weighed and stamped the package,
	and rang the bell for the servant
	to post it. As she took up her magazine
	once more, she noticed on the outside
	cover the same name of street and
	building as on Simeon’s direction, and
	she wondered whether the same publishers
	lent themselves to fact and fancy.</p>

	<p>Her servant brought her something
	to eat on a tray—women left to themselves
	always find economy in discomfort—and
	she nibbled her chicken and
	read her stories till she felt surfeited
	with both, and fell to pondering on
	what made a story effective. Her eye
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>lit upon a short poem at the end of
	a page; it seemed to her poor to banality—did
	it please the public or the editor?
	Her own verses were a thousand
	times better.</p>

	<p>She sat up suddenly with a heightened
	color and shining eyes, and
	laughed out loud. She had an inspiration.
	She, too, would become a contributor
	to that great publishing output;
	she would try her luck at making
	her brains pay her bills. The name
	“Mrs. Simeon Ponsonby” would carry
	weight with the magazine she selected,
	but, while disclosing her identity to the
	editor, she determined to choose a pen
	name, fearing her husband’s disapproval.</p>

	<p>From childhood Deena had loved to
	express herself in rhyme, and of late
	years she had found her rhyming—so
	she modestly called it—a safety valve
	to a whole set of repressed feelings
	which she was too simple to recognize
	as starved affections, and which she
	thought was nature calling to her from
	without. It was nature, but calling
	from within, thrilling her with the
	beauty of things sensuous and driving
	her for sympathy to pen and ink.</p>

	<p>Tossing down her book, she ran to
	her own room, unlocked a drawer, took
	out an old portfolio and returned to
	the study. There were, perhaps, twenty
	poems she had thought worth preserving,
	and her eye traveled over page after
	page as she weighed the merits and
	defects of each before making her
	choice. A sensitive ear had given her
	admirable imitative powers in versification,
	and her father, before dissipation
	had dulled his intellect, had been a man
	of rare cultivation and literary taste.
	Deena, among all his children, was the
	only one whose education he had personally
	superintended, and she brought
	to her passion for poetry some critical
	acumen.</p>

	<p>She finally selected a song of the
	Gloucester fishermen she had written
	two years before—a song of toil and
	death—but with a refrain that effaced
	the terror with the dance of summer
	seas. She wrote a formal note to the
	editor, saying the price was fifteen dollars,
	that if accepted the signature was
	to be Gerald Shelton, and the check
	to be made to her, and she signed her
	own name. Simeon should know as soon
	as he came home, but she thought he
	could have no objection to Geraldine
	Ponsonby accepting a check for the
	supposititious Gerald Shelton.</p>

	<p>Before all this was accomplished, her
	servant had gone to bed and Deena,
	afraid to be left alone downstairs in a
	house so prone to spooky noises, followed
	her example, but alas! not to
	sleep. She tossed on her bed, sacred
	for many years to the ponderous weight
	of old Mrs. Ponsonby, till suddenly all
	she had suffered from the maxims and
	example of her mother-in-law took
	form, and she wove a story half humorous,
	half pathetic, that she longed to
	commit to paper; but her delicacy forbade.
	She was even ashamed to have
	found a passing amusement at the expense
	of Simeon’s mother, and she tried
	to make her mind a blank and go to
	sleep. Toward morning she must have
	lost consciousness, for she dreamed—or
	thought she dreamed—that old Mrs.
	Ponsonby sat in her hard wooden rocking-chair
	by the window—the chair with
	the patchwork cushion fastened by three
	tape bows to the ribs of its back; the
	chair Simeon had often told her was
	“mother’s favorite.” The old lady
	rocked slowly, and her large head and
	heavy figure were silhouetted against
	the transparent window shade. A
	sound of wheels came from the street,
	and she raised the shade and looked out,
	leaning back, in order to follow the disappearing
	object till it was out of range,
	and then she buried her face in her
	hands and sobbed the low, hopeless sobs
	of old-age.</p>

	<p>Deena found herself sitting up in
	bed, the early daylight making “the
	casement slowly grow a glimmering
	square.” The impression of her dream
	was so vivid that the depression
	weighed upon her like something physical.
	It was impossible to sleep, and at
	seven o’clock she got up to dress, having
	heard the servant go downstairs.
	On her way to her bath she passed the
	rocking-chair, and lying directly in her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>path was a little card, yellow with age.
	Deena picked it up and read: “From
	Mother to Simeon.” The coincidence
	worked so on her imagination that she
	sank into the nearest chair trembling
	from head to foot, and then she reflected
	that she must have pulled the
	card out of the table drawer when she
	went to fetch the portfolio the night
	before, and she called herself a superstitious
	<em>silly</em>, and made her bath a little
	colder than usual, as a tonic to her
	nerves. Cold water and hot food work
	wonders, and after breakfast young
	Mrs. Ponsonby forgot she had ever had
	a predecessor.</p>

	<p>Her family paid her flying visits during
	the day, with a freedom unknown
	in Simeon’s reign, and she worked hard
	at her preparations for renting, but in
	the evening, when the house was quiet,
	she settled herself at the study table
	and made her first attempt at story
	writing, this time steering clear of the
	personal note that had brought such
	swift reprisal the night before. The occupation
	was absorbing; she neither desired
	nor missed companionship. She
	was not the first person to find life’s
	stage amply filled by the puppets of her
	own imagination.</p>

	<p>At the end of the week two things
	had happened. <cite>The Illuminator</cite> had accepted
	her poem, and her story was finished.
	She determined to submit it to
	Stephen, and yet when he looked in at
	five o’clock, she was ashamed to ask
	him; what she had thought so well of
	the night before, in the excitement of
	work, suddenly seemed to her beneath
	contempt.</p>

	<p>He lingered later than usual, for he
	mistook her preoccupation for unhappiness,
	and hated to leave her alone.</p>

	<p>“When do you move to your mother’s?”
	he asked, for he thought anything
	better than her present desolation; the
	genteel poverty brought about by Mr.
	Shelton’s habits, the worldliness of Mrs.
	Shelton, and the demands upon time
	and temper made by the younger brothers
	and sisters, were only the old conditions
	under which she had grown up.</p>

	<p>“Next week,” she said, sadly. “I
	shall be sorry to leave here.”</p>

	<p>“You are not lonely, then, poor little
	lady?” he said, kindly, while he searched
	her face to see whether she told the
	whole truth.</p>

	<p>His eyes were so merry, his smile so
	encouraging, that Deena blurted out her
	request.</p>

	<p>“I haven’t felt lonely,” she said, “because
	I have been writing a foolish
	story, and my characters have been my
	companions. I am sure it is no good,
	and yet my head is a little turned at having
	expressed myself on paper. Like
	Dr. Johnson’s simile of the dog walking
	on its hind legs, the wonder isn’t to find
	it ill done, but done at all. I am trying
	to screw my courage to the point of
	asking you——”</p>

	<p>“To be sure I will,” he interrupted,
	eagerly, “and what is a great deal
	stronger proof of friendship, I’ll tell
	you what I think, even if my opinion
	is nihilistic.”</p>

	<p>He followed her into the study, and
	she laid her manuscript on the table and
	left him without a word.</p>

	<p>The story was the usual magazine
	length, about five thousand words, and
	Deena’s handwriting was as clear and
	direct as her character. At the end of
	half an hour she heard his voice calling
	her name, and she joined him.</p>

	<p>“It is very creditable,” he said. “It
	fairly glows with vitality. Without
	minute description, you have conveyed
	your story in pictures which lodge in
	the imagination; but in construction it
	is poor—your presentment of the plot is
	amateurish, and you have missed making
	your points tell by too uniform a
	value to each.”</p>

	<p>“I understand you,” said Deena,
	looking puzzled, “and yet, somehow,
	fail to apply what you say to what I
	have written.”</p>

	<p>He drew a chair for her beside his
	own, and began making a rapid synopsis
	of her story, to which he applied his
	criticism, showing her what should be
	accentuated, what only hinted, what
	descriptions were valuable, what
	clogged the narrative. She was discouraged
	but grateful.</p>

	<p>“You advise me to destroy it?” she
	asked.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>“I advise you to rewrite it,” he answered.
	Then, after a pause, he asked:
	“Why do you want to write?”</p>

	<p>“For money,” she answered.</p>

	<p>“But Simeon told me,” French remonstrated,
	“that he had left you the
	rent of this house as well as part of his
	salary, and a power of attorney that
	makes you free of all he possesses.
	Why add this kind of labor to a life that
	is sober enough already? Amuse yourself;
	look the way you did that day at
	Wolfshead; be young!”</p>

	<p>“Simeon is very generous,” she said,
	loyally, silent as to the restrictions put
	upon his provisions for her maintenance,
	as well as the fact that his salary
	only covered the letter of credit he took
	with him for such expenses as he might
	incur outside the expedition. “In spite
	of his kindness, can’t you understand
	that I am proud to be a worker? Have
	you lived so long in the companionship
	of New England women without appreciating
	their reserves of energy? I
	have to make use of mine!”</p>

	<p>“Then use it in having ‘a good time.’
	I conjure you, in the name, as well as
	the language, of young America.”</p>

	<p>Deena shook her head, and French
	stood hesitating near the door, wondering
	what he could do to reawaken the
	spirit of enjoyment that had danced in
	her eyes the day at Wolfshead.</p>

	<p>“Will you dine with me to-morrow
	if I can get Mrs. McLean to chaperon
	us?” he asked.</p>

	<p>The phrase “chaperon us” was pleasant
	to him; it implied they had a common
	interest in being together, and her
	companionship meant much to him.
	He smiled persuasively—waiting, hat in
	hand, for her answer.</p>

	<p>Deena felt an almost irresistible desire
	to say yes—to follow the suggestions
	of this overmastering delightful
	companion who seemed to make her
	happiness his care, but she managed to
	refuse.</p>

	<p>“Thank you very much,” she murmured,
	“it is quite impossible.”</p>

	<p>It was not at all impossible, as Stephen
	knew, and he turned away with a
	short good-night. He wondered whether
	his friend’s wife were a prude.</p>

	<p>Undoubtedly the refusal was prudent,
	whether Mrs. Ponsonby were a
	prude or no, but it had its rise in quite
	a different cause. She had no dress she
	considered suitable for such an occasion.
	Her wedding dress still hung in
	ghostly splendor in a closet all by itself,
	but that was too grand, and the others
	of her trousseau had been few in number
	and plain in make, and would now
	have been consigned to the rag bag had
	she seen any means of supplying their
	place. They were certainly too shabby
	to grace one of Stephen’s beautiful little
	dinners, which were the pride of
	Harmouth.</p>

	<p>Deena’s ideas of French in his own
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</em> as opposed to him in hers
	were amusing. Viewed in the light of
	Simeon’s friend, voluntarily seeking
	their companionship and sharing their
	modest hospitality, they met on terms
	of perfect equality; but when associated
	with his own surroundings he seemed
	transformed into a person of fashion,
	haughty and aloof. It was quite absurd.
	Stephen was as simple and
	straightforward in one relation as the
	other, but perhaps the truth was that
	Deena was afraid of his servants.</p>

	<p>The house was the most attractive
	in the town, and stood in the midst of
	well-kept grounds with smooth lawns
	and conservatories, and Deena felt oppressed
	by so much prosperity. On the
	few occasions when Simeon had taken
	her there to lunch on Sunday—the only
	dissipation he allowed himself—-she had
	thought the butler supercilious, and the
	maid who came to help her off with her
	wraps, snippy. She had suspected the
	woman of turning her little coat inside
	out after it was confided to her care,
	and sneering at its common lining.</p>

	<p>Deena was too superior a woman not
	to be ashamed of such thoughts, but the
	repression of her married life had developed
	a morbid sensitiveness, and she
	was always trying to adjust the unadjustable—Simeon’s
	small economies to
	her own ideas of personal dignity; she
	hardly realized how much the desire to
	live fittingly in their position had to do
	with her wish to earn an income.</p>

	<p>While Stephen’s criticisms were still
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>fresh in her mind she rewrote her story,
	and when she read it again—which was
	not till several days had passed—she
	felt she had made large strides in the
	art she so coveted.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="four">IV</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>When affairs of a family once begin
	to stir, they seem unable to settle till
	a flurry takes place quite bewildering
	to the stagnant ideas of the easy-going.
	The fact that Deena was coming back
	to her old quarters in the third story
	was the first event to excite a flutter of
	interest in the Shelton home circle; with
	Mr. Shelton, because she was his favorite
	child; with Mrs. Shelton, because
	Deena would both pay and help; with
	the children, because they could count
	upon her kindness no matter how outrageous
	their demands. The next thing
	that happened, while it hastened her
	coming, entirely eclipsed it. Fortunately
	it was delayed until the day before
	the Ponsonby house was to be handed
	over to its new tenant, Mrs. Barnes.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Shelton was busy clearing a
	closet for her daughter’s use when she
	heard her husband calling to her from
	below.</p>

	<p>“Mary,” he said, “here is a telegram.”</p>

	<p>They were not of everyday occurrence,
	and Mrs. Shelton’s fears were
	for Polly, her one absent child, as she
	joined her husband and stretched out
	her hand for the yellow envelope.</p>

	<p>The magnetic heart of a mother is
	almost as invariably set to the prosperous
	daughter as to the good-for-nothing
	son; there is a subtle philosophy in
	it, but quite aside from the interest of
	this story.</p>

	<p>The telegram said:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Mrs. Thomas Beck’s funeral will take place
		on Thursday at 11 A. M.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>It was dated Chicago, and signed
	“Herbert Beck.”</p>

	<p>“Who is Mrs. Beck?” asked Mr.
	Shelton, crossly; the morning was not
	his happiest time.</p>

	<p>“She is my first cousin, once removed,”
	Mrs. Shelton answered, with
	painstaking accuracy. “You must remember
	her, John. She was my bridesmaid,
	and we corresponded for years
	after she married and moved to Chicago
	until”—here Mrs. Shelton’s pale face
	flushed—-“I once asked her to lend me
	some money, and told her how badly
	things were going with us, and she refused—very
	unkindly, I thought at the
	time; but perhaps it was just as well—we
	might never have paid it back.”</p>

	<p>It was Mr. Shelton’s turn to flush,
	but he only said, irritably:</p>

	<p>“And why the devil should they think
	you want to go to her funeral?”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Shelton professed herself unable
	to guess, unless the fact that the
	family was nearly extinct had led her
	cousin to remember her on her deathbed.</p>

	<p>“Well, they might have saved themselves
	the expense of the telegram,”
	Mr. Shelton grumbled, adding, sarcastically,
	“unless they would like to pay
	our expenses to Chicago, and entertain
	us when we get there!”</p>

	<p>It appeared later that was exactly
	what they hoped to do. A registered letter,
	written at Mrs. Beck’s request,
	when her death was approaching, arrived
	within an hour. She begged her
	cousin’s forgiveness for past unkindness,
	told her that she had left her the
	savings of her lifetime—though the
	main part of the estate passed to Mr.
	Beck’s nephew—and besought Mrs.
	Shelton, as her only relation, to follow
	her to her grave. Young Mr. Beck,
	the said nephew, who wrote the letter,
	added that the house should be kept up
	for Mrs. Shelton’s convenience till after
	her visit, and that his aunt had expressed
	a wish that her clothes and
	jewels should be given to Mrs. Shelton.</p>

	<p>“We’ll go, Mary!” said Mr. Shelton,
	blithe as a lark—several things had
	raised his spirits!—and Mrs. Shelton,
	with a burst of her old energy, borrowed
	some mourning, packed her
	trunk, summoned Deena and caught the
	train, with five minutes to spare.</p>

	<p>And so it happened that when Mr.
	French called, as was his daily custom,
	to take his last cup of tea with Mrs.
	Ponsonby before her flitting, he found
	the house in the temporary charge of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>the servant and Master Dicky Shelton,
	a shrimpish boy of thirteen, whose red
	hair and absurd profile bore just enough
	likeness to his sister’s beauty to make
	one feel the caricature an intentional
	impertinence.</p>

	<p>French had got into the drawing
	room before he understood what the
	servant was saying. Deena had gone,
	leaving no message for him! His first
	feeling of surprise was succeeded by
	one of chagrin; these afternoon chats
	by her fireside had become so much to
	him, so much a part of his daily life,
	that he hated to think they had no corresponding
	value to her. He was recalled
	from these sentimental regrets by the
	irate voice of Master Shelton in dispute
	with Bridget.</p>

	<p>“She—<em>said</em>—there—was cake! Mrs.
	Ponsonby—<em>said</em>—there—-was—cake—and—that
	I—could—have
	some!” each word very emphatic, judicial
	and accusative. Then followed a
	rattling tail to the sentence: “And if
	you have eaten it all, it was horridly
	greedy in you, and I hope it will disagree
	with you—so I do!”</p>

	<p>Bridget now came forward and addressed
	French.</p>

	<p>“There ain’t so much as a cheese-paring
	left in the house, Mr. French. Mrs.
	Ponsonby’s gone off at a moment’s notice,
	and I’m off myself to-morrow; and
	there sits that boy asking for cake! He’s
	been here now the better part of an
	hour, trackin’ mud over the clean carpets
	till I’m a’most ready to cry.”</p>

	<p>Dick seized his hat and moved sulkily
	to the door, hurling back threats as
	he walked.</p>

	<p>“Just you wait! We’ll see—you think
	I won’t tell, but I will!”</p>

	<p>French perceived that the case was
	to be carried to the Supreme Court for
	Deena’s decision, and to save her annoyance
	at a time when he felt sure she was
	both tired and busy, he made a proposition
	to the heir of the Sheltons that established
	his everlasting popularity with
	that young person.</p>

	<p>“Come home with me, Dicky,” he
	said, “and if my people haven’t any
	cake, I can at least give you all the hothouse
	grapes you can eat, and some to
	carry home. How does that strike
	you?”</p>

	<p>“Done!” cried Dicky, slipping his
	hand under Stephen’s arm, and, after
	one horrid grimace at Bridget, he allowed
	himself to be led away.</p>

	<p>The sun had nearly disappeared when
	they reached French’s house, which was
	a little outside of the town, and he reflected
	that he must quickly redeem his
	promise, and dispatch his young companion
	home before the darkness should
	make his absence a cause of alarm. He
	rang the bell by way of summoning a
	servant, and then, opening the door with
	his latchkey, he invited Dicky to enter.</p>

	<p>It was a most cheerful interior. The
	staircase, wide and old-fashioned, faced
	you at the far end of the hall, and on
	the first landing a high-arched window
	was glowing with the level rays of the
	setting sun. A wood fire blazed on the
	hearth, and on the walls the portraits of
	all the Frenches, who for two hundred
	years had made a point of recording
	their individualities in oil, looked down
	to welcome each arrival.</p>

	<p>Dicky, who wore no overcoat, presented
	his nether boy to the fire, while
	he gazed at the portraits with a frown.
	He thought them extremely plain.</p>

	<p>A servant came from some hidden
	door, took his master’s coat and hat and
	received an order in which such inspiring
	words as “cakes, or chocolates, or
	dessert of any kind,” gave the earnest
	of things hoped for.</p>

	<p>“And, Charles,” Mr. French concluded,
	“tell Marble to bring the things
	as quickly as he can to the library, with
	a good supply of grapes.”</p>

	<p>Dicky smiled a slow smile. He could
	even allow his mind to wander to other
	things, now that his refreshment was
	drawing nigh.</p>

	<p>“I say, Mr. French, who is that old
	cove over the door, with a frill on his
	shirt and a ribbon to his eyeglass?
	He is nearly as ugly as brother Simeon.”</p>

	<p>Stephen felt genuine alarm; he was
	unused to children.</p>

	<p>“That,” he said, “is my great-grandfather.
	I don’t think he is much like
	your brother-in-law, I must confess.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>“He doesn’t look quite so musty,”
	said Dicky, reflectively. “Did it ever
	seem strange to you, Mr. French, that
	a pretty girl like Deena could marry
	Mr. Ponsonby?”</p>

	<p>“He is a very distinguished man,”
	Stephen replied, in an agony of embarrassment.
	“You ought to appreciate
	what an honor it is to be connected by
	marriage with Professor Ponsonby.”</p>

	<p>“We ain’t intimate,” said Dicky, lightly,
	and his tone betrayed how much
	Simeon was the loser by a restricted intercourse.</p>

	<p>“One of these days when you are a
	little older you will be very proud of
	his reputation,” Stephen protested.</p>

	<p>Dicky walked to the end of the great
	Persian rug on the blue pattern—it was
	evidently a point of honor to avoid the
	red—before he answered:</p>

	<p>“Well, I’m blamed glad he’s gone
	away, anyhow.” And then, to French’s
	relief, Marble came and announced in
	his unctuous voice:</p>

	<p>“The tray is in the library, sir,” and
	all thought of Simeon was abandoned.</p>

	<p>That feast at Stephen’s lived in
	Dicky’s memory for years. It supported
	him through the disappointments
	of many a dessertless dinner—in the
	hopeless fancy engendered by seeing
	sweets pressed to the lips of others;
	it won for him an easy victory in times
	of gustatory boasting when at school.
	He could affirm, with truth, that for
	once he had had his fill of the very best.</p>

	<p>With Stephen also the experience
	was a revelation. The capacity of his
	guest caused him amazement mingled
	with fear.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>And still he gazed</p>
			<p>And still the wonder grew</p>
			<p>That one small boy</p>
			<p><ins id="corr1" class="corr" title="Cold">Could</ins> hold all he could chew.</p>
		</div>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The chiming of the clock reminded
	French that it was already dark and
	high time Dicky was dispatched home.</p>

	<p>“Do you want to take these grapes
	home with you,” asked Stephen, “or
	shall I send you a basket of them tomorrow?”</p>

	<p>Dicky looked coy.</p>

	<p>“If you don’t mind,” he said, “I guess
	I’ll take the chocolates, and you can
	send the grapes to-morrow.”</p>

	<p>He pulled a very dirty handkerchief
	from his pocket, in order to provide a
	wrapping for the chocolates, and, as he
	spread it on the table, a letter dropped
	out. He turned his eyes upon French
	with an expression of sincere regret.</p>

	<p>“I say!” he began. “Now, isn’t that
	too bad! And Deena so particular that
	you should get the note before tea time.
	I’m awfully sorry, Mr. French—it’s all
	Bridget’s fault. Deena said if I got that
	note to you before five o’clock I should
	have a piece of cake, and when Bridget
	wouldn’t give it to me it made me so
	mad I forgot everything. I wanted to
	kill her.”</p>

	<p>“I know just how you felt,” said Stephen,
	with irony.</p>

	<p>Dicky was tying his chocolates into
	a hard ball, but with the finishing grimy
	knot he tossed responsibility to the
	winds.</p>

	<p>“Oh, well,” he said, soothingly,
	“you’ve got it now, at any rate, so
	there’s no occasion for saying just <em>when</em>
	I gave it to you, unless you want to get
	a fellow into trouble.”</p>

	<p>Stephen looked grave; he did want
	Mrs. Ponsonby to know why he had
	failed to follow her suggestion of taking
	tea with her at her mother’s house—and
	also he hated evasion.</p>

	<p>“As it happens, that is the exact point
	I wish your sister to know. I shall not
	tell her, but I expect you, as a gentleman,
	to tell of yourself.”</p>

	<p>“All right,” said Dicky, mournfully.
	“Good-night, Mr. French.”</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="five">V</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Deena had ample time to get accustomed
	to the old home life before her
	parents returned, for she had already
	been in charge for two weeks and still
	they tarried.</p>

	<p>It was evident that young Mr. Beck
	wished to carry out his aunt’s bequests
	in the spirit as well as the letter of her
	instructions, for trunks of linen and
	silver began to arrive from Chicago
	which gave some idea of the loot obtained
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>from the dismantling of Mrs.
	Beck’s fine house. The young Sheltons
	took the keenest interest in unpacking
	these treasures. Children are naturally
	communistic. They enjoy possessions
	held in common almost as much as their
	individual acquisitions—only in a different
	way. There is more glorification in
	the general good luck, but not such far-reaching
	privilege.</p>

	<p>In the midst of these excitements
	Deena received a letter the possession of
	which no one seemed inclined to dispute
	with her. It was from Simeon, posted
	at Montevideo, and containing the first
	news of his voyage. His wife read it in
	the retirement of her own room, but she
	might have proclaimed it from the rostrum,
	so impersonal was its nature. He
	had made an attempt, however, to meet
	what he conceived to be feminine requirements
	in a correspondent, for the
	handwriting was neat, and the facts he
	recorded of an unscientific nature. He
	described his cabin in the vessel, also
	his fellow passengers; not humorously,
	but with an appreciation of their peculiarities
	Deena had not anticipated; he
	introduced her to flying fish, and then to
	the renowned albatross, and he conducted
	her up the river Platte to Montevideo,
	which he described with the
	ponderous minuteness of a guide book.
	At the end he made a confidence—namely,
	that even his summer flannels
	had proved oppressive in that climate—but
	the intimacy of his letter went no
	further, and he omitted to mention any
	personal feelings in regard to their separation.</p>

	<p>It was an admirable family letter, instructive
	and kind, and rather pleasanter
	and lighter in tone than his conversation.
	Deena was glad that no exhortations
	to economy made it too private to
	show to French when he called that
	afternoon. She but anticipated his object
	in coming. He also had a letter
	which he had brought for her to read,
	and they sat on opposite sides of the
	fire, enjoying their exchanged correspondence.</p>

	<p>But what a difference there was in
	the letters; Deena’s had three pages of
	pretty handwriting; Stephen’s six of
	closely written scrawl. In Deena’s the
	ideas barely flowed to the ink; in Stephen’s
	they flowed so fast they couldn’t
	get themselves written down—he used
	contractions, he left out whole words;
	he showed the interest he felt in the
	work he left behind in endless questions
	in regard to his department; he thanked
	Stephen more heartily than he had ever
	done by word of mouth for suggesting
	him for the appointment, and finally he
	gave such an account of his voyage as
	one intelligent man gives another.</p>

	<p>Deena recognized her place in her
	husband’s estimation when she finished
	his letter to Stephen, and said, with pardonable
	sarcasm:</p>

	<p>“Simeon saves the strong meat of
	observation for masculine digestion, and
	I get only the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors-d’œuvres</em>; perhaps
	he has discriminated wisely.”</p>

	<p>The mere fact of being able to exchange
	letters with Deena was a revelation
	to French, and as he walked
	home from their interview his fancy
	was busy putting himself in Simeon’s
	place. The paths that lead through another
	man’s kingdom are never very
	safe for the wandering feet of imagination.
	It is an old refrain, “If I were
	king,” the song of a usurper, if only
	in thought.</p>

	<p>If he were king of Deena Ponsonby’s
	life, Stephen thought, would he write
	letters that another chap might read?
	Would he dwell upon the shape of an albatross,
	when there must be memories—beautiful,
	glowing memories—between
	them to recall? Pen and ink was a
	wretched medium for love, but the heart
	of the world has throbbed to its inspiration
	before now. Why, if a woman like
	Mrs. Ponsonby shared his hearth, he
	would let Tierra del Fuego, with its
	flora and its fauna, sink into the sea
	and be damned to it, before he’d put the
	hall door between himself and her. His
	own front door had suggested the idea,
	and he shut it with a bang.</p>

	<p>He picked up the letters he found
	waiting on the hall table, and went directly
	to his library, passing through a
	room that would have been a drawing-room
	had a lady presided there, but
	to the master served only as a defense
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>against intrusion into the privacy of his
	sanctum.</p>

	<p>The postman had left a pile of bills
	and advertisements, but there was one
	letter in Ben Minthrop’s familiar writing,
	and Stephen turned up his light
	and settled himself to read it. Ben
	wrote:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><span class="name">Dear French:</span> When I asked you to spend
		Christmas with us in Boston I had no idea
		that, like the Prophet Habbacuc, I, with my
		dinner pail, was to be lifted by the hair of
		my head, and transported to Babylon—in
		other words, New York. But so it is! If
		you know your Apocrypha, this figurative
		language will seem apt, but in case you
		should like my end of it explained I will
		leave the mystifications of Bel and the
		Dragon and come down to plain speech.</p>

		<p>My father has conceived the idea that I am
		one of the dawning lights in the financial
		world, and he has decided to open a branch
		office of our business in New York and to
		put me at its head. I must confess that the
		whole thing is very pleasant and flattering,
		and it has stirred all the decent ambitions
		I have—that I have any I owe to you, old
		fellow—and I am rather keen to be off.</p>

		<p>We have taken a house not far from the
		park in East Sixty-fifth Street, where a welcome
		will always be yours, and where Polly
		and I hope you will eat your Christmas
		dinner.</p>

		<p>Perhaps you may reflect that it is a serious
		thing to befriend straying men and dogs;
		they are apt to regard past kindness as a
		guarantee of future interest in their welfare.
		I do not believe, however, that I am making
		too large a demand upon your friendship
		in asking for your good wishes in this
		pleasant turn to my future affairs.</p>

		<p>Of course I want one more favor. If you
		have any influence with Deena Ponsonby,
		will you urge her to spend the winter with
		us? Polly is writing to her by this same
		mail, but I know the New England conscience
		will suggest to Deena that anything
		amusing is wrong, and so you might explain
		that I am nervous about Polly’s health, and
		that I look to her to help me get settled
		without overstrain to my wife—in short, administer
		a dose of duty, and she may see her
		way to coming.</p>

		<p>Ever, my dear French,
			<span class="closing">Sincerely yours,</span>
		<span class="signature">Benjamin Minthrop.</span></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Anger gives to the natural man a
	pedal impulse—in plain language, he
	wants to kick something. Rage flows
	from the toes as freely as gunpowder
	ran out of the great Panjandrum’s
	boots when he played “Catch who catch
	can” on the immortal occasion of the
	gardener’s wife marrying the barber.
	Now, Stephen French was a man of
	habitual self-restraint, and yet upon
	reading Ben Minthrop’s letter he got
	up and—ignoring the poker and tongs—kicked
	the fire with a savagery that
	showed how little the best of us has softened
	by civilization. And yet the letter
	was distinctly friendly, even modest and
	grateful—without one kick-inspiring
	sentence. Stephen began pacing his library
	floor, hurling his thoughts broadcast,
	since there was no one to listen to
	his words.</p>

	<p>Why were people never content to let
	well enough alone? he demanded.
	There was old Minthrop, with enough
	money to spoil his son, laying plans
	for Ben to muddle away a few millions
	in New York in the hope of making
	more; or even if, by some wild chance,
	the boy were successful and doubled it—still
	one would think the place for an
	only son was in the same town with his
	parents. Of course it was their business,
	but when it came to dragging
	Mrs. Ponsonby into their schemes it
	was a different matter. Simeon would
	disapprove, he knew, and as her adviser
	in Simeon’s absence, he felt it his duty
	to tell her to stay at home with <em>her</em>
	parents till her husband returned.</p>

	<p>And then common sense asserted itself,
	and he asked himself what Deena
	owed to her parents; and why Harmouth
	was a better place for her than
	New York; and what possible difference
	it could make to Simeon? The
	answer came in plain, bold, horrid
	words, and he shrank from them. The
	curse of Nathan was upon him; like
	David, he had condemned his friend to
	absence and danger, and had then
	promptly fallen in love with his wife.
	But not willingly, he pleaded, in extenuation;
	it had crept upon him unawares.
	It was his own secret, he had
	never betrayed himself, and so help his
	God, he would trample it down till he
	gained the mastery. Not for one moment
	would he tolerate disloyalty to his
	friend, even in his thoughts. Ben’s
	suggestion was a happy solution of the
	situation as far as he was concerned;
	he would urge Deena to go before his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>folly could be suspected. To have any
	sentiments for a woman like Mrs. Ponsonby
	except a chivalrous reverence was
	an offense against his manhood.</p>

	<p>French was a man who had been
	brought up to respect ceremonial in
	daily living, and he dressed as scrupulously
	for his lonely dinner as if a wife
	presided and expected the courtesy to
	her toilet. Somebody has wisely said
	that unconsciously we lay aside our
	smaller worries with our morning
	clothes, and come down to dinner refreshed
	in mind as well as body by the
	interval of dressing. If Stephen did
	not exactly hang up his anxiety with
	his coat, he at least took a more reasonable
	view of his attachment to his
	neighbor’s wife. He began to think he
	had exaggerated an extreme admiration
	into love—that he was an honorable
	man and a gentleman, and could keep
	his secret as many another had done
	before him; and that if Deena went
	away for the winter it removed the
	only danger, which was in daily meeting
	under terms of established intimacy.</p>

	<p>There was to be a lecture at the
	Athenæum that evening on the engineering
	difficulties incident to building
	the Panama Canal, and Stephen, who
	was interested in the subject, made up
	his mind to start early and stop for a
	moment at the Sheltons’ to carry out
	Ben’s request. He took glory to himself
	for choosing an hour when Mrs.
	Ponsonby was likely to be surrounded
	by a bevy of brothers and sisters; he
	would never again try to see her alone.</p>

	<p>His very footfall sounded heroic
	when he ran up the steps and rang the
	bell. As he stood within the shelter of
	the storm door waiting to be let in, the
	voices of the young Sheltons reached
	him, all talking at once in voluble excitement,
	and then a hand was laid on
	the inside knob and advice offered in
	a shrill treble.</p>

	<p>“You had better run, Deena, if you
	don’t want to be caught,” and then
	more giggling, and a quick rush across
	the hall.</p>

	<p>Dicky threw open the hall door, and
	French, glancing up the stairs, caught
	sight of a velvet train disappearing
	round the turn of the first landing. He
	took the chances of making a blunder
	and called:</p>

	<p>“Come down, Mrs. Ponsonby. It is
	I—Stephen French—and I have something
	to say to you.”</p>

	<p>This was first received in silence, and
	then in piercing whispers, the little sisters
	tried to inspire courage:</p>

	<p>“Go down, Deena; you don’t look
	a bit <em>funny</em>—really.”</p>

	<p>“‘Funny’—ye gods!” thought
	French, as <ins id="corr2" class="corr" title="Dena">Deena</ins> turned and came slowly
	down the stairs. He only wished she
	did look <em>funny</em>, or anything, except the
	intoxicating, maddening contrast to her
	usual sober self that was descending
	to him.</p>

	<p>She was dressed in black velvet of a
	fashion evidently copied from a picture,
	for the waist was prolonged over
	the hips in Van Dykes, and from the
	shoulders and sleeves Venetian point
	turned back, displaying the lovely neck
	and arms that Polly had so envied. Her
	hair was loosely knotted at the back,
	and on her forehead were straying curls
	which were seldom tolerated in the severity
	of her usual neatness. She wore
	a collar of pearls, and her bodice was
	ornamented with two sunbursts and a
	star.</p>

	<p>French, who had never seen her in
	evening dress, was amazed. He seemed
	to forget that he had asked speech with
	her, and stood gazing as if she were an
	animated portrait whose exceeding
	merit left him dumb. He was recalled
	alike to his senses and his manners by
	Dicky, who turned a handspring over
	his sister’s long train and then addressed
	Stephen, when he found himself
	right-end up.</p>

	<p>“I say, Mr. French, mustn’t she have
	been sort of loony to wear a dress like
	that, and she sixty-five?”</p>

	<p>“Who?” asked French, completely
	mystified.</p>

	<p>“Why, mother’s cousin, Mrs. Beck.
	Didn’t you know she had died and left
	us things?” said Dicky, proudly. “A
	trunk full of clothes and diamond ornaments
	came to-day, and mother wrote
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>to Deena to unpack it, and we persuaded
	her to dress up in this. Don’t
	she look queer? That Mrs. Beck must
	have been a dressy old girl.”</p>

	<p>Deena ignored the explanation. She
	appeared to treat her costume as a usual
	and prosaic affair, and said to Stephen,
	almost coldly:</p>

	<p>“You have something to tell me?”</p>

	<p>He wondered whether his eyes had
	offended her, whether the stupidity of
	his admiration had hurt her self-respect.
	She didn’t look at him squarely
	and openly, as usual, but kept her head
	half turned so that the perfect line of
	her throat and chin was emphasized,
	and the tiny curls at the back of her
	neck set off the creamy whiteness of
	her skin. To tell the truth, Deena had
	never before worn a low-necked dress.
	Prior to her early marriage a simple
	white muslin, a little curtailed in the
	sleeves and transparent over the neck,
	had been sufficient for any college
	dance she went to, and after Simeon
	had assumed command, even the white
	muslin was superfluous, for she never
	saw company either at home or abroad.
	Her present costume was sufficiently
	discreet in sleeves—they came almost to
	the elbow, but the bodice allowed so
	liberal a view of neck and shoulders as
	to cover the wearer with confusion. She
	felt exactly as you feel in a dream when
	you flit down the aisle of a crowded
	car in your night clothes, or inadvertently
	remove most of your garments
	in a pew in church, and with Deena
	self-consciousness always took the form
	of dignity.</p>

	<p>Stephen pulled himself together.</p>

	<p>“I have had a letter from Ben,” he
	said, “who seems to think an appeal he
	has made for your company in New
	York this winter will be more apt to
	win a favorable answer if backed up
	by your <em>Temporary Adviser</em>. That describes
	the position Simeon indicated
	for me; doesn’t it, Mrs. Ponsonby?”</p>

	<p>She sank back in her chair and, forgetting
	herself for a moment, allowed
	her eyes to meet his with a merry smile.</p>

	<p>“This seems to be like a conspiracy to
	make a hungry man eat!” she answered.
	“No urging is necessary to
	persuade me to go to New York—why
	should you and Ben suppose I do not
	like to do pleasant things? I shall delight
	in being with Polly—I shall like
	the excitement and the fun—I am perfectly
	mad to go!”</p>

	<p>If it had not been for the exaggeration
	of the last sentence French would
	have been sure of the genuineness of
	her wishes, but the force of the expression
	was so foreign to her usual moderation
	that he asked himself whether
	Deena might not also find a separation
	desirable. The thought sent the blood
	bounding through his veins. If she
	cared for him ever so little, it would be
	easier to let her go—easier if he knew
	she suffered too! Then he called himself
	a coxcomb and a self-deceiver, and
	made a grasp at the good resolutions
	that had almost escaped him.</p>

	<p>“I always knew you possessed that
	adorable quality, common sense,” he
	remarked. “Ben and I might have
	guessed you would do the wise thing.
	When men rush hot-footed into the
	affairs of women, they are apt to play
	the fool.”</p>

	<p>“Is there any reason why I shouldn’t
	go?” she demanded, anxiously.</p>

	<p>“On the contrary, every reason why
	you should; but I feared some mistaken
	idea about expense or Simeon’s approbation
	might interfere with your taking
	a holiday, which you will enjoy as
	much as he enjoys digging up roots in
	Patagonia.”</p>

	<p>Deena considered the two points of
	his answer—expense and Simeon’s approbation—and
	replied thoughtfully:</p>

	<p>“My husband would recognize so
	simple a duty, and, as far as expense
	goes, I am a perfectly independent woman.
	Didn’t you know <em>our</em> story—the
	one you made me rewrite—sold at once,
	and, besides that, I have placed a number
	of fugitive poems? So I snap my
	fingers at expenses till the bank breaks,”
	and she tapped her forehead to indicate
	from whence the supply flowed.</p>

	<p>“Then make the most of the sensation
	while it lasts,” he said, with good-natured
	cynicism, “for expenses have a
	way of sizing you up—cleaning out
	your pockets—and going you one better!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>If you are still snapping your
	fingers when you come back from New
	York, then, indeed, you may boast.”</p>

	<p>A troubled look came into her face.</p>

	<p>“Simeon would like me to go to
	Polly when she is out of health and
	needs me,” she said, in a tone she
	meant to be assertive, but which was
	only appealing, “and if we are careful
	about spending, it is because we are
	proud and do not wish to incur obligations.”</p>

	<p>The <em>we</em> was a masterpiece of loyalty,
	and French was suitably impressed by
	it.</p>

	<p>“Dear Mrs. Ponsonby,” he said, “you
	speak as if <em>I</em> were likely to misjudge
	Simeon, whereas my object in coming
	here was to prevent <em>your</em> misjudging
	him by allowing your sensitive conscience
	to forbid pleasures he would be
	the first to suggest.”</p>

	<p>The speech was genuine; in Stephen’s
	estimation his friend had noble qualities,
	and in bearing testimony to them
	he was beginning his chapter of self-discipline.
	In this interview, at least,
	he had preserved a conscience void of
	offense, and he hastened to say goodnight
	before any temptation should assail
	his discretion. Perhaps, also—for
	he was but mortal—the reflection in the
	parlor mirror of what was passing in
	the hall may have accelerated his departure.</p>

	<p>For the benefit of an admiring gallery
	at the head of the stairs, Master
	Shelton was performing jugglers’ tricks
	with their visitor’s best silk hat. Twice
	it had turned a somersault in the air,
	and twice safely alighted well down
	over Dicky’s ears, but a third time it
	might miss even such a conspicuous
	mark and be smashed out of symmetry
	on the hard floor. French beat a hasty
	retreat, but he was no match for Dicky
	in change of tactics; as he came into
	the hall that young gentleman stood
	stiffly and solemnly waiting to hand
	him his hat and open the front door
	with an air he had copied precisely
	from Stephen’s own servant the day of
	the memorable feast. His presumption
	carried him a little too far, however, for
	as he closed the door on Stephen he
	favored his sister with a comment that
	promptly brought its punishment.</p>

	<p>“If I were an old bag of bones
	like brother Simeon,” he said, grinning,
	“I shouldn’t care to have good-lookin’
	fellows like Mr. French running
	after you twice in the same day,
	Deena!”</p>

	<p>Deena had always been the tenderest
	of elder sisters, but at this apparently
	innocent remark, she first got red as
	fire, and then, paling with anger, she
	rushed at her brother and pulled his
	ruddy locks till he cried for mercy,
	while she burst into tears.</p>

	<p>“Stop it!” roared Dicky, burrowing
	his head in a sofa cushion. “I tell you,
	you’re hurting me! And I’d like to
	know what the mischief <em>you’re</em> crying
	for, anyhow?”</p>

	<p>Deena left the room, her face buried
	in her handkerchief, but she managed
	to answer brokenly:</p>

	<p>“I will—not—allow—you—to call—my
	husband—‘a bag of bones’!”</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="six">VI</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>The house the young Minthrops had
	taken was of a contracted luxury that
	oppressed Deena, accustomed as she
	was to space and sunshine at Harmouth.
	She told Ben that fortunes in
	New York could be gauged by the
	amount of light the individual could
	afford—billionaires had houses standing
	free, with light on four sides; millionaires
	had corner houses with light
	on three sides; while ordinary mortals
	lived in tunnels more or less magnificent
	where electric light had often to
	do duty for the sun. Ben declared that
	his income only admitted light fore and
	aft, but that with skillful decoration
	they could at least travesty the sunshine,
	and so they tried to reproduce its
	effects by wall hangings of faint yellow
	and pale green, by chintz-covered
	bedrooms that seemed to blossom with
	roses, and living rooms sweet with fresh
	flowers. There was no solemn mahogany—no
	light-absorbing color on door
	or window; all was delicately bright
	and gay as the tinting of the spring.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>Deena worked hard to get the house
	ready for Polly, who was still in Boston
	with her mother-in-law, and seemed
	quite content to leave the arranging of
	her new quarters to her sister and husband,
	who preceded her by several
	weeks; indeed, she was becoming so
	accustomed to being waited upon that
	she considered herself in a fair way
	of being spoiled. An heir was expected,
	and an heir seemed a very important
	thing to the elder Minthrops. They
	treated Polly as a queen bee, and the
	rest of the world as slaves to wait upon
	her. She was behaving in a way to
	satisfy their requirements in a daughter-in-law,
	and life was to be smoothed
	accordingly.</p>

	<p>Every day brought a fresh suggestion
	covered by a check. Ben was invited
	to select a high-stepping gray horse—a
	pair of cobs—a tiny brougham—a
	victoria—a piano—a pianola. Deena
	shopped till she almost sank exhausted,
	and yet the requests kept coming. If
	dear Mrs. Ponsonby didn’t mind the
	trouble, perhaps Polly might be warmer
	with sable rugs—perhaps an extra sofa
	in her room might induce her to lie
	down oftener—perhaps a few of those
	charming lace and linen tablecloths
	might make her feel like giving little
	dinners at home instead of fatiguing
	herself by going out to find her amusements.</p>

	<p>Deena would have been more than
	mortal if the image of old Mrs. Ponsonby
	had not risen before her eyes in
	forbidding contrast to so much indulgence.
	She realized that the genus
	mother-in-law has widely differing species,
	and yet in her heart she doubted
	whether Mrs. Minthrop, with money to
	anticipate every wish of her only son,
	loved him a whit more than frugal, self-denying
	Mother Ponsonby had loved
	her Simeon. Lavishness or thrift, alike
	they proved a mother’s affection.</p>

	<p>Deena executed all the commissions
	without a shadow of covetousness and
	rejoiced in her sister’s good fortune;
	it was reserved for Polly and Ben, when
	they took up their life in New York, to
	show her the depths of her own loneliness
	by the fullness of their comradeship,
	and her yearning needs by their
	mutual devotion.</p>

	<p>Polly arrived one bleak December
	day, the week before Christmas, escorted
	by Mrs. Minthrop and two
	maids, and was met at the Grand Central
	by her husband in a state of boyish
	excitement. His delight in having his
	wife with him once more was so genuine
	that Deena forgave him an amount
	of fussiness she never before suspected
	in his easy-going nature. He altered his
	orders half a dozen times as to which
	carriage should bring her from the
	train to the house, and finally ordered
	both; he repeated half a dozen times
	the hour at which the Boston express
	was due, in order that Deena might
	make no mistake about having tea
	served to the minute, and when he had
	shut the front door, on his way to the
	Grand Central, he came tearing back
	to ask the menu for dinner, as Polly
	was apt to be fanciful about her food.
	Deena remembered the time—not two
	years ago—when it was quantity rather
	than quality that balked Polly’s appetite,
	and nearly laughed in his face, but
	she loved her big brother-in-law for
	his forethought.</p>

	<p>The curtains were drawn and the
	lights turned up before the bustle of
	arrival drew Deena to the stairs. First
	old Mrs. Minthrop came, stopping to
	commend the house at every step, and
	then Polly, with her arm linked in her
	husband’s, chattering volubly at the
	delight everything gave her; and Deena,
	wedged between the elder lady and the
	wall in cordial greeting, could not help
	hearing Ben welcome his wife to her
	own home with a sentiment she never
	suspected in him before. Polly flew to
	her sister and kissed and thanked her
	for all she had done, and lavished her
	praises broadcast, and then she insisted
	upon pouring out the tea at her own
	fireside, and Ben perched on the arm
	of her chair; and once, when Deena
	turned suddenly from handing the toast
	to Mrs. Minthrop, she saw him kiss
	Polly’s hair.</p>

	<p>Her thoughts sped back to her parting
	with Simeon, with its prosaic formality—-the
	feel of his puckered lips
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>brushing her forehead. What a lack of
	imagination marked all his dealings
	with her! She felt rebellious and sad;
	not that she wanted any of the luxury
	that surrounded Polly, but she was hungry
	for love. She saw suddenly what
	marriage ought to be, and the realization
	frightened her. How was it she
	had committed this crime against her
	own nature? Was it her sin or her
	parents’ that she had been so blind?
	Not Simeon’s—she exonerated him, she
	knew he had given her as much of himself
	as he had to spare, and that his
	conduct was uniform; what it had been
	at the beginning was now and for all
	time, and if she had suddenly become a
	connoisseur in husbands she was not
	the first woman to whom knowledge
	brought misery. It was not Simeon’s
	fault that he remained stationary while
	her views expanded. Fortunately for
	Deena’s peace of mind, it was Ben who
	figured in these reflections as the exponent
	of what a husband should be, and
	she had no suspicion that it was Stephen
	French who had waked her from her
	domestic coma.</p>

	<p>Poor sleeping beauty, her conscience
	had long ago been pricked by her mother-in-law’s
	spindle, and her whole moral
	sense infected with the belief that to
	keep house wisely was the end and aim
	of wifely duty. She reverenced Simeon
	for his learning and dignity, and felt
	proud that so simple a person as herself
	should have been chosen in marriage by
	a professor of Harmouth. On that she
	had existed for two years, and now she
	was waking up to new needs that stirred
	her like the prince’s kiss.</p>

	<p>Life in the young Minthrops’ dovecote
	soon settled down into a glorified
	routine. The elder Mrs. Minthrop returned
	to Boston, leaving Deena as her
	lieutenant, and perplexing her with the
	multiplicity of her charges; apparently
	Mrs. Ponsonby was to be Providence
	to her sister, with health and happiness
	under her control. The situation was
	paradoxical. Polly was to be denied
	nothing, but not allowed to have her
	own way too freely; she was to be kept
	amused, but most amusements were
	strictly prohibited—she was not to be
	encouraged to think herself an invalid,
	and at the same time her usual occupations
	were taken from her. Deena
	was wise enough to listen and make no
	promises, and when she assumed command
	she contented herself with trying
	to stand between her sister and domestic
	worries.</p>

	<p>Christmas came and went without
	the visit from Stephen, which Ben had
	hoped for, and invitations were pouring
	in for the plethora of social functions
	that mark the season’s height.
	Deena came in for her share, but she
	felt too much of a stranger to venture
	alone into the vortex. Polly entertained
	in a modest way at home—a few people
	at dinner, a friend or two at lunch—and
	this Deena greatly enjoyed, and had
	begun to make herself favorably known
	to a small circle when a stop was put
	to this mild dissipation. The great doctor,
	who had been charged by Mrs.
	Minthrop never to forget her daughter-in-law’s
	inexperience, issued orders
	that Polly was to stay in her room.
	This enforced quiet found an outlet in
	a desire to send Deena everywhere.
	She drove her forth to dinners and
	balls, and the high-stepping gray horse
	was always at her service, and so the
	beautiful Mrs. Ponsonby became the
	fashion. New York does not ask too
	many questions in these days about
	the husbands of handsome married
	women who appear as grass widows
	in its midst; indeed, the suspicion of a
	latent romance or scandal gives a flavor
	to the interest, and Deena suffered not
	a whit from the rumor that she was a
	deserted wife, with money.</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes, there is a husband,” the
	great Mrs. Star admitted. “She married
	him for his money, and he has a
	hobby—fossils, I think it is—and he
	has gone to collect them at Cape Horn.
	She bears his absence surprisingly well,
	doesn’t she? Old Mrs. Minthrop’s son
	married the sister, and she begged me
	to be civil to them. I forget who she
	said they were, but <em>Mayflower</em> people,
	you know.”</p>

	<p>In this way Deena was passed on,
	stamped with the hall-mark of the <em>Mayflower</em>.
	Mrs. Shelton had contributed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>very generously to her daughter’s outfit
	for the season in New York. The
	black velvet picture dress was only one
	of several found suitable for her use
	in the trunk of finery belonging to the
	Chicago cousin, and the jewels that had
	come into the Shelton family from the
	same source were worthy of Deena’s
	beauty. Her clothes were good, and
	she wore them like a princess.</p>

	<p>One evening late in January, Deena
	and Ben were dining with a gay young
	matron, who, without any especial personal
	charm herself, had the faculty of
	drawing to her house the best element
	society had to offer. The engagement
	had been made for them by Polly, much
	against her husband’s wishes, and his
	anxiety at leaving her alone could hardly
	be concealed during dinner. As soon
	as the ladies left the table he excused
	himself to his host, and, following the
	little hostess into the drawing room, he
	whispered a few words in her ear,
	nodded to Deena and disappeared.</p>

	<p>“Your brother-in-law has gone home
	to his wife, Mrs. Ponsonby,” said the
	hostess. “I have never seen such devotion.”
	She laughed a trifle enviously;
	her own infelicities were the talk of
	the town.</p>

	<p>Deena started forward in alarm.</p>

	<p>“Was he sent for? Is my sister ill?”
	she inquired, nervously, and then sank
	back in her chair, smiling, when she
	found it was only a phase of young
	Minthropism.</p>

	<p>While her own daylight hours were
	given to her sister, she was always
	pleased to be out of the way in the
	evening—it left the lovers to themselves—though
	she could not quite free herself
	from a sense of responsibility to the
	elder Mrs. Minthrop.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star, who was beside Deena,
	gave a sniff—if so fine a lady could be
	suspected of such a plebeian way of
	marking her disapprobation.</p>

	<p>“My dear,” she said, “why should
	your charming sister be treated as a
	prisoner over whom somebody must
	perpetually keep watch? I have had
	six children—they were all healthy and
	had their full complement of legs and
	arms—except Bob, who lost an arm in
	the Spanish war, but that doesn’t count—and
	I never was shut up in my room
	before I had to be—nor put on a milk
	diet—nor forbidden reasonable exercise—and
	I think the modern doctors are
	full of fads and greed. Their bills! I
	don’t know who is rich enough to be
	ill nowadays!” Here she shut her eyes
	and trembled to think of the portion of
	her own great fortune that might have
	transferred itself to the doctor’s pockets
	if her nursery had not antedated the
	present school. “It may not seem very
	expensive to young Mrs. Minthrop to
	lie on her sofa and drink milk—but just
	wait till she comes to pay for it!”</p>

	<p>“I don’t believe anyone will care
	about the bill, Mrs. Star,” said Deena,
	“so long as Polly keeps well.”</p>

	<p>“It is bad enough to have food and
	exercise taken away from the young
	mothers,” continued Mrs. Star, who
	was evidently mounted on a hobby, “but
	when helpless infants are deprived of
	their natural sustenance and fed from
	bottles filled in a laboratory and stuffed
	with cotton, it is time for the Gerry Society
	to interfere. Cruelty to children
	is practiced far more by the rich than
	by the poor, in my opinion, and if you
	want to see cases of inanition and feeble
	spines, I’ll show you where to look for
	them, and it won’t be in the tenements!”</p>

	<p>Deena wanted to laugh, but didn’t
	dare to; the old lady proclaimed her
	fierce sentiments with such earnest
	gravity. She managed, however, to say
	politely:</p>

	<p>“You think that science has not improved
	upon nature in rearing the race,
	but you must remember that it finds the
	higher classes existing under unnatural
	conditions.”</p>

	<p>“The conditions would do very well
	if we could banish the doctors,” said
	the old lady, testily. “I am out of patience
	with their incubators and their
	weighing machines and their charts and
	their thermometers—yes, and their
	baby nurses! What do you suppose I
	heard a mother say to her own servant
	the other day: ‘Please, nurse, may
	I take the baby up? He is crying fearfully,’
	and the nurse, who had reluctantly
	put down the morning paper, said:
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>‘No, m’am, when he cries in that angry
	way, he must learn that it is useless!’
	<em>His age was six weeks.</em>”</p>

	<p>Deena burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

	<p>“My dear Mrs. Star,” she said, “I am
	a convert.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star wagged her head in approbation.</p>

	<p>“Just tell your sister what I have
	said, will you?” she pursued, afraid
	that so much wisdom might be lost.
	“And, my dear, since your brother-in-law
	has gone home, suppose you come
	along to the opera with me. I sent
	some tickets to a few stray men, and I
	must look in before the last act.”</p>

	<p>At this point they were joined by the
	gentlemen, and as soon as decency
	would permit, Mrs. Star made her
	adieux, followed by Deena. The Minthrop
	brougham was dismissed, and the
	ladies whirled away in Mrs. Star’s electric
	carriage. She at once took up her
	parable, but this time the topic was not
	the care of infants.</p>

	<p>“I think a great deal of the scenic
	effect of an opera box,” she said. “I
	always dress with respect to the hangings,
	and I never take a discordant color
	beside me if I can help it. You
	happen to please me very much this
	evening; I like the simplicity of the
	white dress. Still, it wouldn’t be anything
	if you didn’t have such a neck—it
	gives an air to any low gown.”</p>

	<p>“It was my wedding dress,” said
	Deena, frankly, “and my sister’s maid
	rearranged it for me. I am glad you
	like it.”</p>

	<p>“Your wedding dress,” said Mrs.
	Star, reflectively. “I think I heard you
	had married a naturalist—prehistoric
	bones, is it not? Very interesting subject—so
	inspiring. Milliken”—to the
	footman, who opened the door on their
	arrival at the opera house—“you may
	keep the carriage here. I shall not be
	more than half an hour.”</p>

	<p>Half an hour for the enjoyment of
	a pleasure that cost her, yearly, a moderate
	fortune!</p>

	<p>On their way through the foyer to the
	box, Deena ventured to disclaim for her
	husband a peculiar interest in fossils.</p>

	<p>“My husband is a botanist,” she began,
	and then desisted when she saw
	her companion’s attention was barely
	held by a desire to be civil.</p>

	<p>“Ah, indeed!” Mrs. Star vaguely responded.
	“Delightful topic. I went into
	it myself quite extensively when I
	was a girl.”</p>

	<p>Deena was not often malicious, but
	she couldn’t help wishing Simeon could
	have stood by to hear this announcement
	of a girlish mastery of his life’s
	work. She tried to think in what dry
	words he would have rebuked the levity,
	but before she could arrange a
	phrase quite in character, they were in
	the front of the box, and in the obscurity
	some one took her hand, and
	Stephen French’s voice murmured:</p>

	<p>“What a piece of luck that I should
	see you to-night! I have only been in
	town a few hours, and obeyed my aunt’s
	summons to the opera as a means of
	keeping myself from Ben’s house till the
	morning. You can’t think how eager I
	have been to see you again, Mrs. Ponsonby.”</p>

	<p>There was a strange break in his
	voice, as if he were trying to restrain
	the rush of happiness.</p>

	<p>All the six mighty artists who made
	the opera the marvel it was were combining
	their voices in the closing sextet
	of the fourth act, and Deena, thrilled by
	the loveliness of the music and, perhaps,
	by the surprise of French’s presence,
	felt she was trembling with excitement.</p>

	<p>“Fancy meeting you here!” she kept
	repeating, the stupid phrase concealing
	the great joy that was puzzling her conscience.</p>

	<p>“What is so wonderful in my being
	in my aunt’s opera box?” Stephen demanded.
	“Cannot a professor of zoology
	like music, or do you object to a
	bachelor owning an aunt?”</p>

	<p>How pleasant it was to hear his kind
	voice, with its good-natured raillery!
	But that was sub-conscious pleasure—her
	immediate attention was busy with
	the first part of his speech about his
	aunt’s opera box; she never supposed
	he had any relations.</p>

	<p>“Who is your aunt?” she asked,
	abruptly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>“Mrs. Star,” he answered. “Don’t
	you see the family likeness?”</p>

	<p>And oddly enough, in the half light,
	there was a distinct resemblance in the
	profile of the bewigged old lady to her
	handsome young kinsman’s. Deena regretted
	both the likeness and the relationship;
	it made her uncomfortable
	to know that Stephen was the nephew
	of this worldly-minded old lady, with
	her fictitious standards and her enormous
	riches; it seemed to place a barrier
	between them and to lift him out
	of the simplicity of his college setting.</p>

	<p>“Have I become a snob in this Relentless
	City’?” she exclaimed. “<em>I</em> find
	my whole idea of you changed by this
	announcement. It depresses me! You
	seem to me a different person here, with
	these affiliations of fashion and grandeur,
	than when I thought of you simply
	as Simeon’s friend.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t think of me simply as Simeon’s
	friend,” he pleaded, half in fun,
	half in sinful earnest.</p>

	<p>“I never shall again,” she said, sadly.
	“Your greatest charm is eclipsed by
	this luxury—I want you to belong to
	Harmouth only.”</p>

	<p>Stephen’s lips were twitching with
	suppressed amusement.</p>

	<p>“There is a proverb, my dear lady,”
	he said, “of the pot and the kettle, that
	you may recall. I am not sure but what
	I may find a word to say to you upon
	the cruelty of disturbing associations.”</p>

	<p>“To me!” she said, turning to him
	with the gentle dignity that was her
	crowning charm. “Surely there are no
	surprises in me.”</p>

	<p>Stephen shook his head in mock disapproval
	as he allowed his eyes to sweep
	from the topmost curl of her head to her
	slipper points, and then he said:</p>

	<p>“Go home, Mrs. Ponsonby, and take
	off that white lace evening dress, and
	perhaps the wreath of holly might come,
	too—and that diamond star on your
	bodice; and put on, instead—let me see—the
	dark blue frock you wore the
	evening I told Simeon about the Patagonian
	expedition, and then you will be
	in a position to reproach me for any
	relapse from the simplicity of Harmouth.
	If you disapprove of me as the
	nephew of my aunt, how do you suppose
	I feel about you? And oh! my
	stars! what would Simeon say?”</p>

	<p>“Simeon,” she said, faintly. “You
	are right; Simeon might not understand——”
	and before French had time
	to protest that he had only been teasing
	her, the curtain went down, strange
	men came flocking into the box, Mrs.
	Star was introducing a Russian grand
	duke, and Stephen, surrendering his
	chair, withdrew to the other side of his
	aunt.</p>

	<p>Deena could not but admire the old
	lady’s admirable manner. She kept up
	an easy chatter, sometimes in French,
	sometimes in English, with the Russian
	and with a Spanish artist; she never allowed
	Deena to feel out of touch with
	the conversation, and in the midst of it
	all she managed to welcome her nephew.</p>

	<p>“You are stopping <em>at</em> my house, of
	course, Stephen? No—at the Savoy?
	That is uncharitable to a lonely old
	woman. Where did you know that pretty
	creature, Mrs. Ponsonby?” she asked,
	seeing that the two foreigners were absorbing
	the attention of her beautiful
	protégée. “You should learn to guard
	the expression of your face, my dear
	boy. I begin to understand why you
	cling so obstinately to Harmouth. I see
	the place has advantages outside the
	work of the college.”</p>

	<p>Here she wagged her head in self-congratulation
	at her own astuteness,
	and Stephen flushed angrily.</p>

	<p>“Hush!” he said. “She will hear you.
	You have little knowledge of Mrs. Ponsonby
	if you think she would permit the
	attentions of any man. She is not in
	the least that kind of person. She is
	one of the most dignified, self-respecting,
	high-minded women I ever knew.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star cut him short with a wave
	of her fan.</p>

	<p>“Spare me the rhapsodies,” she
	laughed. “You merely mark the stage
	of the disease you have arrived at. The
	object of your love sits enthroned! If
	the husband is wise he will throw his
	fossils into the sea and come back to
	look after this pretty possession. Flesh
	and blood is worth more than dry
	bones.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>“Ponsonby is a botanist,” Stephen
	corrected, grimly, while his inward
	thought was that the dry bones were
	Simeon’s own; and then, ashamed of
	the disloyal—though unspoken—sneer,
	he went back to Deena and began talking
	volubly of his last letter from her
	husband.</p>

	<p>They had both had letters from Simeon,
	now safely arrived in the Straits
	of Magellan. He had written to Deena
	when they first cast anchor off the Fuegian
	shore. He described to her the
	visits of the Indians in their great canoes,
	containing their entire families
	and possessions, and the never-dying
	fire of hemlock on a clay hearth in the
	middle of the boat; how they would
	sell their only garment—a fur cloak—-for
	tobacco and rum, and how friendly
	they seemed to be, in spite of all the
	stories of cannibalism told by early voyagers.</p>

	<p>In the midst of this earnest conversation,
	Mrs. Star rose to go, escorted by
	the grand duke, and Stephen, following
	with Deena, was able to let his enthusiasm
	rise above a whisper when they
	gained the corridor.</p>

	<p>“Didn’t he tell you that they were
	all going guanaco hunting?”</p>

	<p>“<em>Simeon!</em>” in a tone of incredulity.</p>

	<p>“Greatest fun in the world, I am
	told,” pursued French; “something like
	stag hunting, only more exciting—done
	with the bolas. You whirl it round
	your head and let it fly, and it wraps itself
	round a beast’s legs and bowls him
	over before he knows what hit him.”</p>

	<p>“Does it kill him?” asked Deena,
	shrinking from the miseries of the
	hunted.</p>

	<p>“Only knocks him over,” explained
	Stephen. “You finish him with your
	knife.”</p>

	<p>“Sport is a cruel thing,” she said,
	shuddering. “I am glad Simeon cannot
	even ride.”</p>

	<p>“Can’t ride!” repeated Stephen. “Indeed,
	I can tell you he means to. He
	says the Indians have offered him the
	best mount they have. They considered
	him a medicine man, on account of his
	root-digging propensities, and treated
	him as the high cockalorum of the
	whole ship’s company.”</p>

	<p>“Surely he is joking,” she said. “Simeon
	is making game of you.”</p>

	<p>“Simeon!” he echoed, mimicking
	her incredulous tone.</p>

	<p>“A joke would be no stranger to him
	than a horse,” she said, smiling.</p>

	<p>They had reached the entrance, and
	Deena stood shaking with suppressed
	laughter. “Fancy! Simeon!” she repeated.</p>

	<p>“And why not Simeon, pray?” asked
	Stephen, slightly nettled.</p>

	<p>A vision of Simeon with his gold-rimmed
	spectacles and stooped figure
	mounted on horseback in the midst of
	a party of Indians, whirling his bolas
	over his head and shouting, presented
	itself to Deena’s imagination. The
	carriage was waiting, and, obeying Mrs.
	Star’s motion to get in first, Simeon
	Ponsonby’s wife fell back on the seat
	and laughed till the tears ran down
	her cheeks.</p>

	<p>Outside, Stephen was entreating to
	be allowed to visit her the next morning.</p>

	<p>“I haven’t half finished my story,
	Mrs. Ponsonby,” he protested.</p>

	<p>And Deena managed to steady her
	voice and invite him to lunch the next
	day.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="seven">VII</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>French’s visit to New York was not
	the result of any weakening resolution
	in regard to his neighbor’s wife; the
	object was business. His property was
	chiefly in real estate, and the distinguished
	law firm who managed his affairs
	had summoned him to confer with
	a tenant who was desirous of becoming
	a purchaser. Being in the same town
	with Deena, he decided that he could
	not well avoid visiting her, to say nothing
	of Ben. It was his misfortune that
	every meeting made his self-discipline
	harder, for, if they lived, he had got
	to see her under still more trying circumstances—reunited
	with a husband
	who misunderstood her.</p>

	<p>These thoughts passed through his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>mind the morning after their encounter
	at the opera, as he finished his breakfast
	at the Savoy. He had an appointment
	at his lawyers’ at ten o’clock, and at
	the Minthrops’ for luncheon at half-past
	one. The first, if properly conducted,
	might result in a largely increased
	income; the second in self-repression
	and a heartache; and yet his
	one idea was to dispatch the business,
	so that no precious moments of Deena’s
	society should be lost to him.</p>

	<p>He was hurrying out of the hotel to
	go downtown, when a telegram was
	put into his hand. For the detached
	bachelor such messages have little interest.
	Stephen opened this one as
	casually as most people open an advertisement—may
	the foul fiend fly away
	with those curses of our daily mail!—and
	read:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="letterdate"><span class="name">Buenos Ayres</span>, Jan. 30.</p>
		<p class="letteraddress"><span class="name">Pedro Lopez</span> to the <span class="name">Hon’ble Professor
		French</span>, Harmouth University.</p>

		<p><em>Tintoretto</em> on its way home. Ponsonby
		missing.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Stephen read the dispatch several
	times before he quite understood its
	significance. Pedro Lopez was his
	South American friend, who had set
	on foot the Fuegian expedition and applied
	to Harmouth for a botanist; the
	<em>Tintoretto</em> was the vessel furnished by
	the Argentine Government.</p>

	<p>The cable message had gone to Harmouth
	and been repeated to New York,
	probably by Stephen’s butler.</p>

	<p>The first effect of evil tidings is apt
	to be superficial. We receive a mental
	impression rather than a shock to the
	heart. We are for the moment spectators
	of our own misfortunes, as if the
	blow had produced a paralysis to the
	feelings, leaving the intellect clear.</p>

	<p>Stephen went back to his own room
	conscious of no emotion except intense
	curiosity as to what had become of
	Simeon, though, perhaps, far back in
	his mind anxiety was settling down to
	its work of torture.</p>

	<p>He flung himself into a chair near
	the window which overlooked the entrance
	to the park and let his eyes gaze
	blankly at the busy scene. It had
	snowed during the night, and sleighs
	were dashing in and out under the
	leafless arches of the trees. Bells were
	tinkling, gay plumes of horsehair floating
	from the front of the Russian
	sleighs and the turrets of the horses’
	harness, men and women wrapped in
	costly furs were being whirled along,
	laughing and chatting, through the
	crisp morning air.</p>

	<p>Stephen didn’t know he was receiving
	an impression—he thought his mind
	was at a standstill, but whenever in the
	future that terrible day came back to
	his memory, he always saw a picture,
	as it were, of the brilliant procession
	dashing into the city’s playground,
	while Saint Gaudens’ statue of Sherman
	stood watching, grim and cold,
	with the snow on his mantle and his
	Victory in a winding sheet.</p>

	<p>It was not very long before French
	was able to pull himself together and
	to face the situation. What did it
	mean? Had Simeon lost himself in the
	Patagonian wilds or was he drowned?
	French felt that he couldn’t carry such
	an uncertain report to Deena, the strain
	upon her would be too great. It was
	horrible to have to tell her at all, but
	he must try to make the news definite—not
	vague. Gradually he thought out
	a course of action; he would telegraph
	to Lopez to send him a detailed account,
	cabling the answer at his expense,
	and until this reply came he
	thought himself justified in concealing
	the news. Lopez was in constant communication
	with the expedition, and
	the letter which had announced Ponsonby’s
	disappearance must have gone
	into particulars.</p>

	<p>After dispatching this cable he kept
	his appointment in Wall Street, transacting
	the business with the dull precision
	of a person in a hypnotic sleep,
	and then presented himself at the Minthrops’
	a few minutes before the lunch
	hour. He had not been prepared to
	find Deena installed as hostess, and her
	manner of greeting him and presiding
	at the lunch table was so assured, so
	different from the timid hospitality she
	was wont to offer under Simeon’s roof,
	that her whole personality seemed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>changed. She more than ever satisfied
	his admiring affection, but she was so
	unlike the Mrs. Ponsonby of Harmouth
	that he felt like confiding to this gracious,
	sympathetic woman the tragedy
	that threatened her other self.</p>

	<p>Early in the day, before that woeful
	message came, he had counted the minutes
	he could spend with her, and now
	he was timing his visit so as to curtail
	it to the least possible duration, and
	taxing his ingenuity as to how best to
	avoid seeing her alone. It was Saturday,
	and he trusted to the half holiday
	for the protection of Ben’s presence;
	his depression of spirits would be less
	noticeable in general conversation.</p>

	<p>He arrived on the stroke of the hour
	set for lunch, and to his chagrin was
	shown to the library, where Deena was
	sitting alone. His trouble deepened, for,
	after motioning him to a chair beside
	her, she resumed her embroidery and
	said, with a quizzical expression:</p>

	<p>“You were in the midst of Simeon’s
	last letter when we parted last evening,
	Mr. French; please go on with it.
	You may remember you left my unfortunate
	husband pledged to become a
	horseman.”</p>

	<p>Stephen could not respond to her
	merry mood; his anxiety was to steer
	the conversation away from Simeon,
	and he had run against a snag at the
	start.</p>

	<p>“At all events, I left him safely surrounded
	by friends,” he said—more in
	answer to his own feelings than her
	banter.</p>

	<p>In thinking over any disaster, the
	mind loves to dwell on the peaceful moments
	that preceded it. Stephen found
	comfort in recalling the gay tone of
	Simeon’s letter, his delight in his coming
	adventure, and the good feeling that
	evidently existed between him and the
	ship’s company.</p>

	<p>Deena took exception to his remark.</p>

	<p>“You have strange ideas of safety!”
	she laughed. “Not content with mounting
	a confirmed pedestrian on a wild
	horse of the Pampas, you must needs
	turn him loose among a horde of savages.
	The hunt had not taken place
	when he wrote, had it? It is a pity, for
	I should like Simeon safely back on
	shipboard without the loss of spectacles
	or dignity.”</p>

	<p>She would like Simeon back!
	What wouldn’t French give to know
	her husband was still alive!</p>

	<p>The butler announced lunch, and Ben
	came dashing downstairs, delighted to
	see Stephen and full of excuses at having
	lingered in his wife’s room. He
	said Polly was feeling rather poorly,
	and Stephen was glad to see a look of
	anxiety cross Deena’s face; he rightly
	judged her thoughts had been diverted
	from Patagonia to Polly’s sofa, and he
	breathed once more.</p>

	<p>What a pleasant luncheon it was, in
	spite of the lurking dread. Deena was
	wearing the old blue dress he had recommended
	to her the night before. It
	could not be from coquetry—she was
	above coquetry—but perhaps she had
	put it on to recall associations; to remind
	him of the close bonds of friendship
	that existed between them in those
	pleasant autumn days that followed
	Simeon’s departure. Stephen was not
	very learned in the make of women’s
	frocks, but he understood color and
	could appreciate how that steely-blue
	made her complexion glow warm as
	ivory and her hair like copper.</p>

	<p>They were pretending to quarrel
	over a dish of salted almonds; Deena
	declared that French was getting the
	lion’s share, and finally covered the little
	silver basket that held them with her
	hand. On the third finger flashed old
	Mrs. Ponsonby’s diamond in its antiquated
	silver setting, and below it was
	her wedding ring, the narrow band that
	symbolized her bondage to Simeon.
	For the first time since French had received
	the cable, its possible significance
	to him took possession of his
	mind, and he flushed a dull red and
	fell into a reverie.</p>

	<p>In all probability there was no longer
	any barrier between him and the
	woman he loved; nothing to prevent his
	striving to win her, but the period of
	her mourning—the respect she owed to
	the memory of a husband who was the
	palest shadow of a lover, and not even
	the ghost of a companion. He wondered
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>whether she had ever guessed
	his feelings—feelings which he had
	subdued and held under with all the
	strength of his nature, partly through
	fear of forfeiting her friendship and
	partly because her charm was in the
	simplicity of her goodness. If love had
	once been named between them, Deena
	would have been other than herself.</p>

	<p>Her voice roused him. She was excusing
	herself in order to go to her sister,
	and leave him and Ben to smoke.
	He held the door open for her to pass
	with a profound sense of relief—no suspicion
	of his awful secret had been betrayed.
	But oh! the comfort of talking
	it over with Ben, of sharing the
	burden with another! They discussed
	the meager announcement till they had
	exhausted every probability and found
	nothing to hope and everything to fear.</p>

	<p>“I hope to Heaven he is dead!” cried
	Ben. “Imagine a man physically weak,
	like Ponsonby, enduring slow starvation
	in the damp and chill of the Patagonian
	seacoast. It will be a positive
	relief if we hear he fell overboard.”</p>

	<p>“Anything is better than uncertainty,”
	said Stephen, and the speech must
	have been from the new point of view,
	the hope of Deena’s freedom, for the
	next moment he was conscious of a
	wave of shame.</p>

	<p>“I ought to get an answer from Lopez
	before night,” he added, rising to
	go; “and as soon as I hear I will return
	and let you know.”</p>

	<p>Ben followed him to the front door,
	whispering like a conspirator and glancing
	furtively up the stairs. There was
	a childish streak in the boy’s nature
	that gloried in a confidence; the joy
	of the secret nearly made up for the
	sorrow of the fact. But secrets and
	sorrows were soon put out of his head,
	for a crucial moment had come to the
	young Minthrops—one we anticipate
	and are never quite prepared for.</p>

	<p>As he ran upstairs, after seeing Stephen
	off, he met Deena, evidently looking
	for him.</p>

	<p>“Oh, Ben,” she said, “Polly is ill,
	and I have telephoned for——”</p>

	<p>But she got no further, for her big
	brother-in-law turned white as a frightened
	girl, and when he tried to speak no
	sound came from his lips.</p>

	<p>“Goose!” said Deena, laying an affectionate
	hand on his shoulder. “Shall
	I get a glass of brandy? Do you suppose
	no one has ever met with this experience
	before?”</p>

	<p>Ben recovered himself with a fit of
	irritation, which seems the corollary to
	being frightened.</p>

	<p>“Brandy!” he repeated. “Why in
	thunder should I want brandy? Really,
	Deena, for a sensible woman, you
	are given at times to saying the most
	foolish things I ever heard.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p>In the meanwhile, as the afternoon
	was still early, French was anxious to
	find some occupation that might distract
	his thoughts. He decided to visit
	his aunt, whose conversation was usually
	startling enough to hold the attention
	of her hearers in any stress of agitation,
	and then when he was halfway
	up her steps repented the intention, on
	the ground that he needed soothing
	rather than stimulating; but his retreat
	was cut off by the good lady coming
	out of her door and discovering him,
	and, as she was about to walk round
	the block for exercise before taking her
	afternoon drive, she promptly claimed
	his company for both occasions. The
	wind blew her dress up to her ankles
	as she reached the sidewalk, displaying
	a pair of pointed-toed, high-heeled boots
	that perforce made walking—even
	round the block—a torturing task. But
	Mrs. Star was a brave woman, and
	walking a matter of conscience, so she
	tottered along beside her nephew, occasionally
	laying a hand on his arm when
	a bit of icy pavement made her footing
	more than usually uncertain.</p>

	<p>“How I hate the late winter in New
	York!” she exclaimed, when a few minutes
	later they were seated in her sleigh
	on their way to the park. “Here we
	are at the threshold of February, when
	any self-respecting climate would be
	making for spring, and we must count
	on two months more of solid discomfort.
	Ah, well, this year I do not mean
	to face it. I have had the yacht put in
	commission, and she sails next week for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>the Mediterranean, where I shall overtake
	her by one of the German boats,
	and do a little cruising along the African
	coast. Come with me, Stephen,”
	she said, coaxingly. “Let this silly
	school-teaching go. You are a rich
	man—why under the sun do you want
	to work? If you are holding on to
	Harmouth on account of that pretty
	Mrs. Ponsonby, it can’t do you much
	good when she is in New York. Besides,”
	she added, quite as an afterthought,
	“it is bad morality, and you
	ought to be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

	<p>He was about to turn and rend her
	for what he considered an unpardonable
	meddling with his affairs, when
	he saw her eyes fixed on him with tenderest
	affection and his anger melted.</p>

	<p>“Dear Stevie,” she said, “be good-natured
	and bear an old woman company—you
	know you are as dear as
	my own sons.”</p>

	<p>She used to call him Stevie when he
	was a lonely little boy, and she made
	her house his home; when all he knew
	of family life was supplied by that good-natured,
	worldly household—the name
	touched a chord of memory that softened
	his irritation.</p>

	<p>“I wish I could, Aunt Adelaide,”
	he answered, “but I have managed to
	tie myself to my work in a way you
	cannot understand. You will have to
	take Bob as a companion.”</p>

	<p>Bob was her only unmarried child,
	wedded only to his clubs and amateur
	soldiering, and even less available than
	Stephen for a cruise.</p>

	<p>“Bob!” she said, contemptuously.
	“He never voluntarily went to a foreign
	country except Cuba, and I don’t
	believe he knows on which side of the
	Mediterranean Africa lies! I shall find
	some one who will be glad to go with
	me—perhaps your charming friend,
	Mrs. Ponsonby, might go. She looks
	as if she would be a pleasant traveling
	companion.”</p>

	<p>French’s heart tightened as he
	thought of the horror that stood between
	Deena and pleasure, and was
	even debating in his mind whether it
	would not be better to tell his aunt the
	truth, when conversation was rendered
	impossible for the moment by the puffing
	and tooting of a great automobile
	advancing toward them down the west
	drive of the park—its wheels slipping
	in a crazy manner, that made the coachman
	of Mrs. Star’s sleigh give it a wide
	berth. Just as it got abreast of them,
	it became perfectly unmanageable—slewed
	to the left, made a semicircle
	which turned it round, and, catching
	the back of the sleigh on its low front,
	turned the light vehicle over as easily
	as if it had been made of pasteboard.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star allowed herself a shrill
	shriek as the sleigh went over and then
	lay quite still in a heap by the side of
	the road, with Stephen across her feet.
	The automobile seemed to have recovered
	its serenity, for it now stood still
	like any well-behaved machine, quiet
	save for its noisy breathing, while the
	sleigh was being bumped, on its side,
	far up the road, at the heels of the
	outraged horses.</p>

	<p>French scrambled to his feet and endeavored
	to help his aunt, who had
	raised herself to a sitting posture and
	was looking white and disheveled, while
	she cast furious glances at the motor
	and its owner. She took her nephew’s
	hands and attempted to rise, but fell
	back, declaring she had broken her
	knee, as it hurt her excruciatingly
	when she tried to move it.</p>

	<p>The owner of the auto now came
	forward in great contrition to offer
	help and apologies. He was a physician,
	he explained, hastening to a case
	of great urgency, and he had taken his
	automobile as the quickest means of
	covering the distance, though he had
	known it at times to behave badly on
	slippery and snowy roads.</p>

	<p>The admission was a mistake—it put
	him in the wrong, and Mrs. Star, who
	distrusted all modern doctors, felt a
	consuming rage against this one in particular.</p>

	<p>“You must have a strange estimate
	of a physician’s duty if you feel justified
	in risking many lives to save one!”
	she said, haughtily. “Not that you are
	much worse than the fire engines and
	ambulances. We ought to add a petition
	to the litany for safety against our
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>safeguards, for they kill more than they
	rescue.”</p>

	<p>The gentleman bore her sarcasms
	with becoming humility, and begged to
	be allowed to take her home, promising
	that the machine should execute no
	more “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyages en zigzag</em>,” and she,
	ashamed of her temper, forced herself
	to decline, with some graciousness,
	though she made it very plain that no
	person on earth could tempt her to get
	into the automobile.</p>

	<p>“At least let him tell you whether
	your knee is seriously hurt,” Stephen
	whispered, loath to see the medical help
	departing.</p>

	<p>“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” retorted
	Mrs. Star. “A nice spectacle
	you would make of me by the roadside!
	Besides, I am not going to allow
	my knee to buy him a new automobile.
	Thank Heaven, I know how to guard
	my pocket against the medical profession—I’ll
	not stir from this spot till he
	takes himself off.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t be so foolish!” urged French.
	“If your knee is injured it is a very serious
	thing.”</p>

	<p>“Well, it isn’t seriously injured,” she
	said, perversely. “I have changed my
	mind, and I mean to have it tied up
	with witch hazel.”</p>

	<p>Fortunately her equipage was now
	seen approaching in the charge of two
	park policemen, who had stopped
	the horses about a mile further on,
	righted the sleigh and now brought it
	back not much the worse for the misadventure.
	The coachman and groom
	were collected from the bushes, and, as
	they were quite uninjured, Stephen
	lifted his aunt into the back seat and
	they turned their faces homeward.</p>

	<p>However much the rest of the party
	may have been inconvenienced, French
	had certainly attained the object of his
	solicitude—namely, to have his thoughts
	distracted from Simeon Ponsonby.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="eight">VIII</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>The second cable from Lopez arrived
	soon after dinner; it brought small comfort.
	Its nineteen words told the story
	but too conclusively.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Strayed from party while hunting. Weather
		turned foggy. Search parties persevered for
		two weeks. Hope abandoned. Expedition
		homeward bound.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>There was no further excuse for concealment;
	indeed, it was French’s plain
	duty to tell Deena what might be told
	by the newspapers if he delayed.</p>

	<p>It was just nine o’clock, and he
	walked rapidly to the Minthrops’ and
	rang the bell. Outside an electric cab
	was waiting, its great lamps casting
	pathways of light across street and sidewalk.
	The motorman was inside; an
	indication that long waiting had driven
	him to shelter, though the circumstance
	had no significance to Stephen.</p>

	<p>The bell was answered by the butler,
	who looked portentous and stood resolutely
	in the doorway.</p>

	<p>“Not at ’ome, sir,” he said, in response
	to Stephen’s request to see Mrs.
	Ponsonby.</p>

	<p>“Then I must see Mr. Minthrop,”
	French insisted.</p>

	<p>The man hesitated and then relaxed
	his wooden expression.</p>

	<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. French. I
	did not recognize you, sir. The truth
	is, we’re a bit h’upset h’inside. Mrs.
	Minthrop is tuk ill, sir—very sudden—and
	we’re expecting the good word
	every minute. I shall tell Mr. Minthrop
	you called.”</p>

	<p>Stephen nodded and turned away—the
	fates had ordained that he was to
	carry his secret till the morning. It
	had been a harassing burden in the
	daylight hours, but during the night it
	became maddening; it seemed beyond
	his resolution to tell Deena that the
	pleasure trip he had set on foot for her
	husband’s advantage had ended in
	death.</p>

	<p>As early as he thought permissible,
	the next morning, he presented himself
	at Ben’s door—this time gaining, a
	cheerful admission—and was shown to
	the library on the second floor. There
	he found the young father, radiantly
	happy, and so self-centered that he had
	entirely forgotten the misfortune overhanging
	his sister-in-law.</p>

	<p>“Come and see my son,” he said,
	proudly, and in spite of an expression
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>of reluctance on the part of French to
	intrude into the upper regions of the
	house, he pushed him ahead of him up
	the next flight of stairs and knocked
	softly at the door of a back bedroom.</p>

	<p>Deena’s voice bade them enter, and
	French was ushered into a large room
	fitted out as a nursery, with the newest
	appliances for baby comfort. There
	was a bassinette so be-muslined and be-ribboned
	and be-laced that it looked
	like a ball dress standing by itself in
	the middle of the floor; and a bathtub
	that looked like a hammock; and
	a weighing machine; and a chart for
	recording the daily weight; and a large
	table with a glass top; and a basket containing
	all the articles for the Lilliputian
	toilet; while near the fender some doll-like
	clothes were airing.</p>

	<p>Deena was sitting in a low rocking-chair
	near the fire with her nephew in
	her arms. She welcomed her visitors
	with a smile, and turned down a corner
	of the baby’s blanket to display his
	puckered ugliness to Stephen. She was
	looking happy, tender, proud, maternally
	beautiful.</p>

	<p>“Hasn’t he a beautifully shaped
	head?” she demanded, passing her hand
	tenderly over the furry down that
	served him for hair. “And look at his
	ears and his hands—was there ever anything
	so exquisite?”</p>

	<p>It was French’s first introduction to
	a young human, and he found it slightly
	repulsive, but Deena, in her Madonna-like
	sweetness, made his heart swell.</p>

	<p>“He is part of an exquisite picture,”
	he answered.</p>

	<p>Ben, who had been for a moment
	with Polly, now came into the room
	with his usual noisy bustle, and Deena
	got up and, surrendering the baby to
	the nurse, led the way downstairs.</p>

	<p>At the library door Stephen paused to
	whisper to Ben:</p>

	<p>“Stay with me while I tell her,” in
	tones of abject fright; but Ben shook
	his head.</p>

	<p>“Look here, old man,” he said, in
	mild remonstrance, “if you had had a
	baby last night, you wouldn’t be casting
	about for fresh trouble to-day—now,
	would you?”</p>

	<p>Stephen gave him an indignant
	glance, and, following Deena, he shut
	the library door. He did it in so pronounced
	a way that she looked up surprised,
	and was even more at a loss to
	account for the gravity of his expression;
	she wondered whether he had
	thought her rude yesterday when she
	had disappeared from the table at lunch
	and had never returned, but it was not
	like French to be touchy.</p>

	<p>“I left you very unceremoniously yesterday,”
	she began, “but the nurse appeared
	for a moment at the door, and
	I did not want to alarm Ben. You were
	not offended?”</p>

	<p>“Believe me, no,” French answered,
	with a sort of shudder; “for the first
	time in my life I was glad to see you go—your
	presence was torture to me—I
	was concealing something from you,
	Mrs. Ponsonby, and it has got to get
	itself told.”</p>

	<p>While he spoke her expression
	changed rapidly from amazement to
	alarm, and she got up and came close
	to him—waiting—but without a word.</p>

	<p>“Simeon is lost,” he said, hoarsely,
	hurling the bald fact at her before his
	courage failed. “I tried to tell you
	yesterday,” he went on, drawing the
	cables from his pocket, “but I couldn’t;
	it all seemed so vague at first, and I
	ventured to wait until I got more
	news.”</p>

	<p>She was standing before him with
	her hands clasped and her face deadly
	pale, but with a calm that frightened
	him.</p>

	<p>“Do you mean lost at sea?” she
	asked, in a steady voice—toneless but
	perfectly clear.</p>

	<p>He shook his head.</p>

	<p>“No—on land. He was hunting—it
	must have been the very hunt we were
	talking about—and wandered from his
	party. A fog came on, and they were
	unable to find him. Lopez telegraphs
	that they sent out search parties for a
	fortnight, but could find no trace.”</p>

	<p>He longed for a word from her, but
	none came.</p>

	<p>“At last they abandoned hope,” he
	concluded. “The expedition is now on
	its way home.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>She had turned her back upon him,
	and he waited in misery to hear her sob,
	to see her shoulders shake with her
	weeping; but, instead, the whole figure
	seemed to stiffen, and, wheeling round,
	she faced him with blazing eyes.</p>

	<p>“The cowards!” she cried. “To abandon
	a man to starvation! What are
	they made of to do such a barbarous
	thing!”</p>

	<p>“We must not judge them unheard,”
	Stephen ventured. “Their search may
	have been exhaustive—they may have
	risked their own lives gladly—and you
	know,” he added, gently, “that beyond
	a certain time it would have been useless
	from the standpoint of saving life.”</p>

	<p>“It was inhuman to sail away and
	leave him,” she went on, beating her
	hands together in a sort of rage. “How
	can you defend them! You, who sent
	him off on this horrible journey—how
	can you sleep in your bed when you
	know Simeon in perishing by inches! I
	should think you would be on your way
	now—this moment—to search for him!
	Oh, do something—don’t just accept it
	in this awful way. Haven’t you any
	pity?” Unconsciously she laid her hand
	on his shoulder, as if she would push
	him from the room.</p>

	<p>Stephen bore her reproaches with a
	meekness that exasperated her.</p>

	<p>“Are there no cables to Magellan?”
	she asked. “There must be somebody
	there who for money would do your
	bidding. Don’t waste time,” she answered,
	stamping her foot.</p>

	<p>Stephen kept his temper. Perhaps he
	was shrewd enough to see that it was
	pity rather than love that gave the
	fierceness to her mood. It was the
	frenzy of a tender-hearted woman at
	hearing of an act of cruelty rather than
	the agony of one who suffers a personal
	bereavement.</p>

	<p>“Deena,” he said, not even knowing
	he had used her name, “do you really
	want me to go on this hopeless errand?
	Think of its utter uselessness—the time
	that has elapsed, the impossibility of
	penetrating into such a country in the
	advancing winter. It is the first of
	February, and I could not get there
	before March; it would be already their
	autumn. By this time he has either
	reached help or he is beyond it.”</p>

	<p>At the beginning of his speech
	Deena’s pale face flushed, but as he
	went on setting forth the obstacles to
	his going she seemed to harden in her
	scorn.</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes,” she sneered. “Let him
	die! It is cold in Patagonia for a gently
	nurtured person like Mr. French.
	Simeon is poor in friends—he only had
	one besides his wife, and that one is a
	fair-weather friend. But I’ll go—I am
	not afraid of privation. I’ll entreat the
	Argentine Government for help—I’ll
	make friends with the Indians—I’ll——”</p>

	<p>“Hush,” he said, “you have said
	enough—I will go.”</p>

	<p>Having gained her point, she burst
	into tears.</p>

	<p>“I am cruel,” she said, “selfishly cruel
	to you, who have been so good to me—but
	whom can I turn to except to you?
	How can we abandon Simeon without
	raising a finger to save him? Say you
	forgive me.”</p>

	<p>He held out his hand in mute acquiescence.
	Her sneers had stung him
	to the quick, but her appeal to his manhood
	for help in her distress moved
	him deeply.</p>

	<p>“Perhaps,” she went on, half to herself,
	“perhaps if I had been a better
	wife—if I had loved him more, I could
	bear it better—but it is so pitiful. He
	has always been alone in life, and now
	he is dying alone.”</p>

	<p>Stephen, who was pacing the floor,
	tried not to listen. He knew she was
	not thinking of him when she was
	confessing her shortcomings to her own
	conscience, but the admission that she
	felt herself lacking in love to Simeon
	filled him with a deep joy. He did not
	dare to linger.</p>

	<p>“I am going,” he said, gently. “Good-by,
	Deena. Will you pray God to send
	you back the man who loves you?”</p>

	<p>She stood staring at him dumb with
	misery, but as the door shut between
	them a cry of anguish burst from her
	very soul.</p>

	<p>“Come back!” she cried. “Oh, Stephen,
	come back! I can’t bear it! I can’t
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>let you go! Don’t you know I love you?—and
	I have sent you off to die!”</p>

	<p>She knew that he had gone—that her
	appeal was to the empty air, and she
	flung herself on the sofa in a frenzy
	of sobs. But the cry reached Stephen
	in the hall, where he stood battling with
	himself against his yearning for one
	more look, one more word to carry
	with him, and at the sound his resolution
	melted like wax in the flame of
	his passion. With a bound he was
	back in the room, on his knees beside
	her, soothing her with tenderest endearments—pouring
	out the fullness of his
	love.</p>

	<p>“Must I go, Deena?” he pleaded.
	“Must I leave you when I know you
	love me? And for what?—a search for
	the dead!”</p>

	<p>At his words her conscience woke
	with a stab of shame.</p>

	<p>“Yes, go!” she said. “Go quickly. A
	moment ago I sent you in the name of
	compassion; now I send you in expiation
	for this one intolerable glimpse
	of Heaven.”</p>

	<hr class="dots" />

	<p>Stephen, eager to do her bidding,
	went straight to Mrs. Star’s house to
	take leave of the only person to whom
	he owed the obligations of family affection,
	and found that redoubtable lady
	on a sofa in her dressing room. In answer
	to his expressions of regret at
	this intimation of invalidism, she gave
	an angry groan.</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes!” she said. “Our medical
	friend has succeeded in providing another
	doctor with as pretty a case of
	water-on-the-knee—to say nothing of
	other complications—as he could desire.
	My only comfort is, he didn’t get the
	charge himself.”</p>

	<p>“But you have seen a specialist, surely?”
	exclaimed French, who feared her
	hatred of physicians might have prevented
	her calling in proper aid.</p>

	<p>“Don’t distress yourself,” she answered.
	“McTorture has me fast in
	his clutches; and for how long do you
	suppose? Two months! He will promise
	nothing short of two months, and
	even then objects to my going abroad,
	and the yacht ready to start this very
	week! I am waiting for Bob to come
	into lunch, to get him to send for the
	sailing master and break the news to
	him. He’ll be a disappointed man!”</p>

	<p>“I will take the yacht off your hands,”
	said Stephen, casually.</p>

	<p>“You!” she exclaimed. “Are you
	running away <em>from</em> or <em>with</em> anybody,
	that you suddenly annex an ocean
	steamer? You were prosing only yesterday
	afternoon about work and duty,
	as if nothing could separate you from
	Harmouth. Is the attraction going to
	bolt with you, Stevie?”</p>

	<p>Stephen could have killed her as she
	lay there, allowing her tongue free play
	with his most intimate concerns, but the
	respect due to an old woman, to say
	nothing of an aunt, restrained his anger,
	and he answered, coldly:</p>

	<p>“If you want to get rid of the yacht
	for the rest of the year, say so. My
	friend, Simeon Ponsonby, is lost in the
	wilderness of Patagonia, and I am organizing
	a party to search for him. I
	shall have to resign my work at Harmouth,
	but I feel responsible for poor
	Ponsonby’s fate; I sent him on the expedition.”</p>

	<p>“Ah! did you?” she said, laughing
	wickedly. “Poor Uriah has been disposed
	of, and now the lady sends you
	to look for his bones. Don’t look too
	hard, Stevie, you might find he wasn’t
	lost, after all!”</p>

	<p>“Stop!” cried French, springing to
	his feet. “How dare you make a jest of
	other people’s misfortunes? Is there so
	little decency among your associates
	that you no longer recognize it when
	you see it?”</p>

	<p>She had the grace to look ashamed.</p>

	<p>“Take the yacht, my dear,” she said,
	kindly, “and if the expense is too great
	for your income, you can draw on me
	for what you like. Can’t you stand a
	little teasing from your old aunt?”</p>

	<p>“I will take the yacht, and pay for
	it,” said French. “As for the teasing,
	we seem to have different ideas about
	what is amusing.”</p>

	<p>“Then forgive me,” she pleaded, and
	there were tears in her eyes, “and be
	careful of yourself, my dear boy, in this
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>dismal expedition. Take plenty of furs,
	and beware of the cannibals.”</p>

	<p>She won a smile from him as he bent
	over her sofa to kiss her good-by, but
	she reserved further comments upon his
	errantry for Bob.</p>

	<p>“Quixotic nonsense!” she declared.
	“Was there ever a man so wise that a
	woman couldn’t make a fool of him?”</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="nine">IX</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Could there be a crueler irony of fate
	than to be absolutely convinced of the
	widowhood of her you love and to be
	unable, practically, to establish the fact?</p>

	<p>Stephen French had expatriated himself,
	resigned the work he valued, put
	the seas between himself and Deena,
	only to be baffled at every turn. For
	two months he had used his utmost
	acumen in prosecuting the search without
	even finding a clew, and when finally
	he made his great discovery, it was
	by yielding to the impulse of the moment
	rather than the suggestions of
	reason.</p>

	<p>From March to May Mrs. Star’s
	great ocean-going yacht had steamed
	along the southeastern shores of Patagonia.
	Sometimes within the confines
	of the Straits, sometimes rounding its
	headlands into the Atlantic, and dropping
	anchor wherever the line of coast
	gave any facility for landing an exploring
	party, until the hopelessness of the
	quest was patent to everybody except
	Stephen.</p>

	<p>On his way down he had stopped at
	Buenos Ayres, where he provided himself
	with the charts and surveys made
	by the newly returned expedition, and
	secured Simeon’s personal effects left
	on the <em>Tintoretto</em>, together with his
	diary, scientific memoranda and specimens,
	which had been carefully preserved,
	and were of rare value, from a
	botanist’s point of view.</p>

	<p>French was fortunate enough to induce
	both Lopez and the captain of the
	<em>Tintoretto</em> to accompany him as guests,
	and they proved invaluable allies, especially
	the captain, whose topographical
	knowledge and recent experience were
	always to be relied upon. From him
	Stephen learned all the particulars of
	Simeon’s disappearance, though the last
	home letter dispatched by the poor fellow,
	on the eve of the guanaco hunt,
	covered the first part of the story. It
	appeared that Ponsonby had landed
	with a surveying party from the ship,
	one morning in January, on the Patagonian
	side of the Straits, and set out to
	botanize while his companions worked.
	He had climbed a steep bank, in order
	to secure a particular shrub just in
	flower, when he saw on the plain beyond
	a party of Indians gathered by the
	shore of a small, fresh-water lake.
	Most of them were watering their
	horses, but half a dozen were grouped
	round a man lying on the ground, apparently
	injured. Their sharp eyes
	quickly marked Simeon filling his vasculum
	with the coveted specimens, and,
	waving their hands in friendly greeting,
	two of them advanced at a gallop. One
	spoke fairly good Spanish, and explained
	that the son of their chief had
	broken his leg by a fall from his horse,
	and he begged Simeon—whom he conceived,
	from his occupation of gathering
	simples, to be a medicine man—to
	come to their assistance.</p>

	<p>Simeon’s own Spanish was too poor
	to undeceive them, but, thinking he
	might be of some use, he went back with
	them, and rigged out a set of splints,
	that made it possible to carry the young
	man to their encampment, about a mile
	away. In gratitude for his services,
	they accompanied him to the ship on his
	return, mounting him on one of their
	horses and forming a bodyguard round
	him. It was then that they proposed the
	guanaco hunt to the officers of the ship;
	their own visit to the Straits being simply
	in pursuit of game.</p>

	<p>The morning of the hunt the captain
	described as unusually warm for
	that region, even in January, and not
	particularly clear; there was a haze that
	was just not a fog. The Indians met
	them about a mile back from the shore,
	bringing a dozen extra horses for their
	guests. The quietest beast was selected
	for Ponsonby, but its docility was so
	questionable, and the rider’s inexperience
	so evident, that the captain persuaded
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>him to give up the chase, and
	content himself with a ride to the encampment
	to inquire about his patient.
	The last ever seen of him he was sitting
	on horseback watching the departing
	hunt.</p>

	<p>Guanacos in large numbers had been
	seen on the plains to the northwest,
	whereas the Indian camp lay to the
	northeast, and Ponsonby’s route was
	widely divergent to that of the hunters.
	All that was known is that he never
	reached the encampment; perhaps he
	mistook the trail, and, having left his
	compass in his cabin, had no means of
	ascertaining his direction—or perhaps
	his horse became unmanageable and
	bolted, carrying him far inland; at all
	events, his chance without a compass
	was poor, for a tremendous rain came
	on, which lasted for three days, leadening
	the sky to an even gray, with no
	mark of setting or rising sun.</p>

	<p>At the end of four days the horse he
	had ridden came into camp riderless;
	its saddle had been removed, probably
	by Simeon, to make a pillow at night,
	and its whole appearance bespoke long
	travel. For a fortnight the ship’s company
	and the Indians scoured the country
	seeking him. They sent up rockets
	at night, and lighted fires on the hilltops
	by day; they wearied themselves
	and the tireless Indians, and at last,
	knowing the limits of human endurance
	in a case like Ponsonby’s, they gave up
	in despair.</p>

	<p>All these incidents formed the main
	topics of conversation in the long evenings
	in the saloon of the yacht. In addition
	to Señor Lopez and the captain
	of the <em>Tintoretto</em>, Stephen had secured
	the services of a young physician with
	a taste for adventure, and his own sailing
	master was a person of intelligence,
	so that the little party brought a variety
	of experience to the councils held on
	board ship or round the camp fire when
	their search carried them so far inland
	that it was impossible to return to the
	yacht at night. Several times, accompanied
	by Pecheray guides, they had
	been gone for ten days at a time, but
	never found a trace of the lost man.
	There was the faint possibility that he
	had been found and cared for by wandering
	Indians, but what was far more
	likely was that French might stumble
	upon the spot where he died. Even in
	that land of beasts and birds of prey
	something would be left in evidence.</p>

	<p>The daylight hours were now so few
	that little could be accomplished, and
	the cold was becoming severe. A violent
	snowstorm on the fifteenth of May
	decided French to give up the search
	and go home. Accordingly, they
	steamed out of the Straits of Magellan
	and turned the vessel northward, keeping
	as near the Patagonian shore as was
	prudent, in the hope of sighting canoes.</p>

	<p>They had been steaming in this direction
	for about three hours, going slowly
	and keeping a sharp outlook toward the
	land, when the captain called French’s
	attention to an opening in the coast
	line, where the Gallegos River empties
	into the sea. An impulse—perhaps it
	might more truly be called an inspiration—induced
	French to order the yacht
	brought to anchor in the bay. Although
	the shore seemed deserted, several canoes
	filled with Indians immediately put
	out for the yacht, as was, indeed, their
	invariable custom. The boats were
	large, capable of holding six or eight
	people in the two ends, while in the middle
	was the inevitable clay hearth, on
	which smoldered the fire of hemlock.
	As they approached the yacht, the Indians
	began begging for rum and tobacco,
	some by gestures and some in a
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</em>, in which Spanish and Indian
	words were strangely blended; and
	French, whose policy was always to secure
	their good will, invited them on
	board and ordered the steward to bring
	spirits and tobacco, and also a plentiful
	supply of ship biscuit and sweets.</p>

	<p>The men were of medium size, and
	not bad looking, and for the most part
	dressed in loose-fitting mantles of
	<ins id="corr3" class="corr" title="guano">guanaco</ins> skins, stained bright red. In
	spite of the cold, this one garment was
	their only protection, and even this they
	would offer in exchange for rum.
	Knowing their customs, French was astonished
	to find the first man who
	stepped on board wearing the coat of
	civilization under his mantle, and his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>astonishment gave way to alarm when
	he recognized an old checked cutaway
	of Simeon’s, which had done service
	for many a winter at Harmouth, and
	was as unmistakable as the features of
	its lost owner. While Stephen stared—too
	agitated to find a word of Spanish—-the
	Indian tossed off half a tumbler of
	raw whisky at a gulp and, drawing
	from the pocket of poor Simeon’s coat
	a silver flask, he presented it to the
	steward to be filled with the same genial
	fluid. The flask was Stephen’s
	parting gift to Simeon, and marked
	with his name.</p>

	<p>The excitement now became intense,
	for the Indians declared that the owner
	of the coat was alive, and the one who
	was wearing it, and who seemed to exercise
	some authority over the others,
	began an explanation in signs. He
	pointed to a cliff that overhung the
	stony beach at the mouth of the river,
	and, lifting his hand high above his
	head; brought it down with a violent
	gesture, as if to simulate a fall. He next
	motioned toward the canoes, talking
	volubly all the while, though his language
	was unintelligible to anyone except
	the captain of the <em>Tintoretto</em>, who
	picked out a word here and there.</p>

	<p>The tribes of the Straits of Magellan
	and the adjacent coasts vary greatly in
	their characteristics; some have the
	impassive bearing we associate with the
	Indian, and some are imitative, reproducing
	sounds and gestures with surprising
	exactness.</p>

	<p>It was not difficult to guess that Simeon
	had fallen over the cliff and been
	found by the Indians, who are always
	skirting the shore in their canoes, and
	the Spanish captain made out that he
	was now in one of their boats higher
	up the river. When the Indian was
	asked whether he would guide them to
	the place, he hesitated until bribed by
	rum and provisions, and then he agreed
	to go in his own canoe and bring Simeon
	to the yacht, where the exchange
	was to be effected. Why he hesitated
	remained a mystery, unless Ponsonby’s
	knowledge of herbs had made him of
	value to the tribe.</p>

	<p>French immediately ordered the various
	tins and boxes, containing the supply
	of food promised, to be placed conspicuously
	on the deck as an earnest of
	his honesty in the barter, and when a
	small keg of rum was added, the satisfaction
	was complete; four or five Indians
	followed their leader into his
	canoe and paddled up the river.</p>

	<p>They were gone so long—over three
	hours—that French began to curse his
	folly in trusting them, and he was about
	to follow them up in the launch, when
	he saw their canoe coming round a bend
	in the stream. At the first glance it
	seemed filled with Indians only, and it
	was not until it was actually alongside
	that he detected a mummy-like form
	lying in the stern, which he guessed to
	be Simeon.</p>

	<p>Half a dozen sturdy arms made the
	transfer, by means of a hammock, from
	the canoe to the yacht, and Simeon,
	alive but quite unconscious, was laid on
	the deck. He had probably been subjected
	by the removal to more pain than
	in his enfeebled condition he could bear,
	and it required long and patient exertion
	on the part of the doctor before he
	was revived from his syncope.</p>

	<p>His condition was pitiable; from an
	injury to the spine he was a helpless
	cripple, while the arm which had been
	broken in his fall had knit in a way to
	render it perfectly useless. He was
	fearfully emaciated, probably from the
	lack of palatable food, and his expression
	was vacant.</p>

	<p>French gave up his own deck cabin,
	the most commodious in size, and before
	another hour had passed Simeon was lying
	in a comfortable bed, clean, warm,
	devotedly tended, but apparently dying.</p>

	<p>For forty-eight hours they kept the
	yacht within the shelter of the river,
	fearing the effect of motion on that
	feeble flame of life, but the warmth and
	nourishment soon began to tell, and on
	the third day he recognized French, and
	tried to murmur some words of gratitude
	and pleasure.</p>

	<p>That night Stephen called the doctor
	into his own room and shut the door.
	He wanted to put a very simple question,
	one which might have been asked
	anywhere out of Simeon’s hearing, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>yet the effort seemed almost beyond his
	powers.</p>

	<p>“Can he live?”</p>

	<p>The words came in such a hoarse, unnatural
	voice that the doctor, a sensitive
	man, feared to deal the blow of
	truth. This was a very marvel of
	friendship; like the love of David and
	Jonathan, it passed the love of women.</p>

	<p>The doctor temporized. Mr. Ponsonby
	had rallied wonderfully; his constitution
	was much stronger than he had
	been given to understand; it was rather
	soon to give a definite opinion, but——</p>

	<p>Here Stephen interrupted him.</p>

	<p>“Great God, man! Can’t you answer
	a plain question. Yes or no?”</p>

	<p>The doctor drew himself up and, to
	quote his own language, “let him have it
	straight.”</p>

	<p>“If he lives to get home it will be a
	good deal more than I expect of him.”</p>

	<p>French nodded toward the door, and
	turned his back.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p>That night he relieved the doctor’s
	watch by sitting up with his friend, and,
	having given him his broth at midnight,
	was almost dozing in his chair when a
	whisper from Simeon roused him. The
	sound was so faint, he held his breath to
	listen.</p>

	<p>“Stephen, I want to see Deena.”</p>

	<p>French’s heart began thumping like
	the screw of his yacht. How he thanked
	God that he could look his friend in the
	face as he answered:</p>

	<p>“So you shall, old man; just as quickly
	as steam can carry you to her.”</p>

	<p>A look of satisfaction came into the
	tired eyes.</p>

	<p>“It will be a race with death,” he said,
	“but perhaps—thank you, Stephen.”
	And he fell asleep.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="ten">X</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>With Deena the spring moved drearily.
	Her position was strangely anomalous;
	she was neither wife nor widow,
	without the right to be glad or sad—only
	dumbly wretched. She could not
	mourn for a husband who might be living,
	nor could she ignore the fact that
	he might be dead, and all the while that
	parting scene with Stephen burned into
	her conscience like a brand.</p>

	<p>She shut herself up with Polly and
	the baby, and hardly went out of the
	house while she remained in New York.
	Love for the child crept deep into her
	heart and soothed her into patience
	when all else failed.</p>

	<p>In May the house in Harmouth returned
	to her keeping, the lease having
	expired, and she left the Sixty-fifth
	Street household with reluctance to take
	up her old life. In the great city she
	had been but a human atom. Her conduct,
	her unhappiness, her very existence
	mattered to no one there, except,
	perhaps, to Ben and Polly, who were as
	tender and sympathetic as such vigorous
	people could be; but in Harmouth
	every creature was interested in Simeon’s
	fate, and watched Deena with a
	curiosity she found maddening.</p>

	<p>She felt herself the main topic of conversation;
	she never approached two
	people talking in the street that they
	didn’t break off in guilty confusion, and
	comments upon her mode of dressing
	and daily occupations were continually
	repeated to her in the form of censure.
	Her own family were especially out of
	touch, for their assumption that she
	mourned her husband as Polly would
	have done made her feel like an impostor.
	They did not give her much of
	their company, for their newly found
	fortune made them even more self-centered
	than their misfortunes. Dicky
	was the exception; perhaps because he
	had started in life hard as nails, and so
	couldn’t grow any harder. At all
	events, Deena thought she discerned a
	reluctant affection in his greeting that
	was infinitely flattering.</p>

	<p>Stephen wrote whenever he could
	catch the Chilian mail boats on their
	way through the Straits. His letters
	were those of a man under the strong
	hand of restraint; admirable letters, that
	filled her with respect for him and
	shame at her own craving for “one
	word more.”</p>

	<p>On the twenty-fifth of May she had
	a cable that changed the face of events.
	It was from Montevideo.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>Have found Simeon. Desperately ill. On
		our way home.</p>

		<p class="signature">S. French.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The news spread over the town like
	wildfire. The local paper issued an extra;
	a thing it had not done since the
	assassination of Mr. McKinley. As
	soon as Harmouth knew Mrs. Ponsonby’s
	exact status it became distinctly
	friendly. People are helpful by instinct,
	and offers of neighborly assistance
	poured in from all sides.</p>

	<p>Deena left nothing undone that could,
	by anticipation, add to Simeon’s comfort.
	His room was ready, a nurse engaged,
	and all the paraphernalia belonging
	to the care of the sick collected long
	before the time due for his arrival. She
	counted upon seeing him four weeks
	from the date of the cable. The regular
	trip of the mail boats between Rio
	and New York is twenty days; from
	Montevideo two days more; to that
	must be added another day to reach
	Boston, and she was warned that a
	yacht would go more slowly than a
	large steamer; she therefore concluded
	the third week in June would bring
	them.</p>

	<p>The lot of women is to wait, and they
	do it under a pressure of nervous strain
	that makes it slow torture. No turn of
	fortune could have surprised Deena at
	this crisis, for her imagination had pictured
	every possibility.</p>

	<p>When a summer storm blackened the
	sky she saw the yacht tempest-tossed
	and sinking, driven before a tropical
	cyclone; when the sun shone, she fancied
	it sailing gayly into port with Simeon
	restored to health, expecting to find
	her as he left her—the willing slave, the
	careful housewife—and she shivered
	and went pale at the thought; and then
	in a revulsion of feeling she saw him
	dying, and she was ready to cast herself
	at his feet, and tell him all—how she
	had tried to do right, how she had
	struggled against her love for Stephen.
	Perhaps he would have mercy upon her
	and let her go away, all by herself, to
	wrestle with her heart.</p>

	<p>She couldn’t eat; she couldn’t sleep.
	She grew so wan and thin she was like
	a ghost of her old self.</p>

	<p>Her mother said:</p>

	<p>“My dear, you must stop fretting.
	I am sure, under the care of that clever
	young doctor Mr. French took down,
	and with the comforts of the yacht,
	your husband will be quite himself by
	the time he gets home.”</p>

	<p>And her father added:</p>

	<p>“You must not be so impatient,
	Deena; it is mighty nasty sailing
	through West Indian waters, and a boat
	of that size doesn’t carry enough fuel
	for a prolonged voyage; they will have
	to stop for coal somewhere on their way
	up.”</p>

	<p>She was growing irritable under her
	dread. Like Elisha, she longed to silence
	them with the answer:</p>

	<p>“I know it; hold ye your peace.”</p>

	<p>The middle of June had passed, the
	fourth week of the voyage had begun,
	and now any day, any hour, might
	bring news. Deena’s anxiety had made
	such inroads into her health that her
	father took alarm and called in her old
	friend Dr. Hassan, and he, wise man,
	gave her a sedative and ordered her to
	bed, though the afternoon was still
	young.</p>

	<p>It was the first long sleep she had had
	for weeks, and the refreshment came at
	the time of her direst need, for at daybreak
	the summons roused her. She
	waked with a beating heart; wheels
	stopped in the street, her gate clicked,
	there were footsteps coming up her
	path—bold, hurried steps; they reached
	the veranda—the bell pealed.</p>

	<p>She sprang from her bed, huddling
	her dressing gown round her as she
	ran, and, slipping back the heavy, old-fashioned
	bolts of the front door, she
	stood face to face with Stephen.</p>

	<p>If she were pale, he was paler; his
	blood seemed turned to ice that summer
	morning.</p>

	<p>“The yacht is at Wolfshead,” he said.
	“How soon can you be ready? We
	must go by rail—I have a special waiting
	for you.”</p>

	<p>A glow from the first blush of day
	caught her as she stood in the frame of
	the doorway. She was like a mediæval
	saint, with her hair wound in a crown
	about her head, her blue gown falling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>in stately fold, and her bare feet showing
	under the hem of her nightgown.
	In spite of her seeming calm, her eyes
	blazed with excitement.</p>

	<p>To French she seemed something
	holy and apart—as if those bare feet
	rested on a crescent, and the shadows
	of the old hall were floating clouds. He
	had schooled himself during his hurried
	journey, in order to meet her without
	emotion, but she was her own protection;
	to have touched her would have
	seemed sacrilege. Her lips tried to
	frame the question that consumed her
	with its terrors.</p>

	<p>“Simeon——” she began, but her
	voice failed.</p>

	<p>Stephen’s haggard eyes softened.</p>

	<p>“He is dying,” he said. “But there is
	time—perhaps to-day—perhaps to-morrow.
	His force of will has kept him
	alive to see you—he has cared more
	than you knew.”</p>

	<p>She gave a little sob, and turned toward
	the staircase. Halfway up she
	stopped.</p>

	<p>“I forgot to ask you to come in,” she
	said, “or whether you want anything I
	can get you? But it doesn’t matter,
	does it? All that matters is to do Simeon’s
	bidding. I shall be very quick.”</p>

	<p>In an incredibly short time she was
	back, fully dressed, and carrying a bag,
	into which she had thrust what was indispensable
	to her comfort for another
	day. She waked the servant, left a message
	for her father, and then she and
	Stephen went out into the street, so gay
	with early sunlight and twittering birds,
	so bare of human traffic. At first a
	strange shyness kept her dumb; she
	longed to ask a thousand things, but
	the questions that rose to her lips
	seemed susceptible of misunderstanding,
	and Stephen’s aloofness frightened her.
	Did he think, she wondered, that she
	could forget her duty to Simeon at such
	a moment, that he surrounded himself
	with this impenetrable reserve? And
	all the time he was regarding her with
	a passionate reverence that shamed him
	into silence.</p>

	<p>At the railway station their train was
	waiting—the locomotive hissing its impatience;
	they got into the car, for there
	was but one, and in a moment were
	flying seaward. A man—the steward
	of the yacht—was busy at the far end
	of the car with a cooking apparatus, and
	the aroma of coffee came intoxicatingly
	to her nostrils. She remembered she
	had eaten nothing since her early dinner
	the day before, and she was exhausted
	with excitement, and then she
	despised herself for thinking of her
	physical needs when Simeon lay dying.
	It was fortunate that French had taken
	a saner view of the situation, for the
	coffee was just what was needed to restore
	her equipoise.</p>

	<p>She began to understand the delicacy
	of her companion’s conduct, and the
	simplicity of the whole situation when
	stripped of morbidness. The only thing
	that behooved her was to soothe her
	husband’s last hours on earth—to give
	out the tenderness of a pitying heart. As
	her common sense asserted itself she began
	plying Stephen with the questions
	that had seemed so impossible half an
	hour before—would Simeon know her—could
	he bear conversation—was he
	changed in appearance—had he suffered
	beyond relief? She demanded the whole
	story of his rescue and of the voyage
	home. She was gentle, womanly, infinitely
	sweet. By the time they reached
	their destination all constraint was
	gone; they were two comrades absorbed
	in a common interest, for Simeon
	occupied their every thought.</p>

	<p>There was a narrow pier at Wolfshead,
	sheltered by a point of rocky
	shore that made a landing for small
	boats in good weather, and there the
	steam launch was waiting with its two
	trim sailors and its gaudy flag. The
	yacht was anchored about a mile from
	shore—her graceful outlines clearly defined
	against the ocean’s blue. If the
	purity of her white paint had suffered
	in the long voyage it was not apparent—red
	and white awnings were stretched
	over the deck. All looked hospitably
	gay. Once more Deena shrank into herself,
	the brilliant scene mocked the tragedy
	within.</p>

	<p>All too quickly they crossed the intervening
	water; they were on the deck—in
	the saloon. She was trembling so
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>she could hardly stand, and Stephen
	put her into a comfortable chair and
	left her, while he made her coming
	known. She hardly glanced at the luxurious
	fittings of the charming room;
	her eyes were fixed on the door, dreading,
	yet impatient, for the message.</p>

	<p>A small, sensitive-looking man came
	toward her and introduced himself.</p>

	<p>“I am Dr. Miles,” he said, “Mr. Ponsonby’s
	physician, and, if you will allow
	me, I will take you to him now.
	There is no question of saving his
	strength, Mrs. Ponsonby. We have
	been nursing what is left to him for
	days, in order that he could lavish it in
	this interview with you. Don’t try to
	curb him; let him have his say.”</p>

	<p>She followed him to a deck cabin almost
	under the bridge, and stood for a
	moment at the threshold, to make sure
	of her composure. There was a narrow
	brass bed, a chest of drawers, a washstand,
	and close to the bed a wicker
	chair, with silk cushions, was drawn up,
	as if in expectation of a guest. The
	head of the bed was toward her, so that
	she couldn’t see Simeon’s face, but he
	heard the rustle of skirts, and called
	her name, and she made a step forward
	and sank on her knees beside him.</p>

	<p>“Oh, Simeon,” she gasped, “how you
	have suffered! I am so sorry!”</p>

	<p>He moved his hand feebly and patted
	her shoulder, and she, in a passion of
	pity, carried it to her lips. For the first
	time she ventured to look at him. Was
	this Simeon! She would have passed
	him in a hospital ward as an utter
	stranger, so completely was he changed.
	He had discarded his spectacles, and his
	eyes were dull and faded; pain had
	robbed them of that expression of concentrated
	wisdom she knew so well. He
	wore a short, curling beard and mustache,
	and his clothing, supplied from
	Stephen’s wardrobe, was luxurious; it
	was silk, of a faint color between blue
	and gray, and the handkerchief, protruding
	from the pocket, was delicately
	fine. Extreme neatness was characteristic
	of Simeon, but he disliked anything
	florid in dress or appearance, anything
	opposed to the austere simplicity
	that marked his manner of living. She
	wondered whether such things mattered
	to him now.</p>

	<p>He noticed her start of surprise as
	her eyes met his, and fancied she was
	shocked by the ravages of illness, for he
	said, with a touch of his old irritation:</p>

	<p>“Didn’t they tell you I was dying?
	Are you afraid to be left alone with me?
	You used to be a courageous person,
	Deena.”</p>

	<p>The querulousness with which he began
	the sentence melted into a rallying
	smile.</p>

	<p>“Oh, no,” she said, “I am not afraid.
	I am too sorry to be frightened.”</p>

	<p>“There is a bell, in case you want to
	summon the doctor,” he continued, “but
	I should rather talk to you alone. I
	have been very homesick for you, and
	for the old house—sometimes the longing
	has been most acute—and then the
	anxiety of leaving you poorly provided
	for has been part of my distress. If I
	could have lived a few years more this
	would have been obviated, and possibly,
	even now, my book will add something
	to your income.” He made a visible
	effort to speak clearly. “Now, in regard
	to your future support; I have a
	life insurance of ten thousand dollars,
	and securities to about the same amount—and
	then, of course, the house. This
	is all I have been able to save, though
	I have cut our living down to bare necessities.
	You have been of great assistance
	to me, Deena—without you life
	would have had little flavor, but sometimes
	I fear that in the desire to provide
	for your future I was not considerate
	enough of your present. I ought to
	have been more mindful that young
	people need pleasure. You will have to
	forgive that and many other mistakes.”
	He looked at her almost wistfully.</p>

	<p>Deena’s tears came, dripping plentifully
	over her clasped hands.</p>

	<p>“It is I who should ask forgiveness,”
	she said, humbly, remembering how
	often she had scorned his economies.
	“The money is more than I shall need—don’t
	think of it again, Simeon. Isn’t
	there anything you want to tell me about
	your work—your book?”</p>

	<p>His face lit up eagerly—the topic was
	congenial.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>“My papers are safe,” he said. “All
	the initial work of classification and description
	that I did on the <em>Tintoretto</em> is
	in French’s keeping, and he and Sinclair—the
	man who has my place—are going
	to edit the book. We have had a
	great deal of talk about it on the way
	up, whenever I had a fairly quiet day.
	It is idle to try to put into words what
	I owe French.”</p>

	<p>“And he feels nothing but self-reproach
	for having urged you to go,”
	said Deena, faintly. “Not that anyone
	could have foreseen the miserable outcome.”</p>

	<p>“It isn’t miserable!” Simeon answered,
	almost fiercely. “In many respects
	it is all that I hoped. I have
	made a name for myself—there will not
	be a scientific library in the world without
	my book, when once it is issued.
	People have died for lesser achievements
	than that.” And then he added,
	more gently: “Not that it could be considered
	as an achievement without
	French’s aid.”</p>

	<p>His mind could not detach itself from
	its debt of gratitude, for he suddenly
	broke out in passionate eulogy.</p>

	<p>“He has sacrificed everything to me—his
	ambitions—his time—his comfort—his
	money, though that is the last
	thing he would begrudge, but you have
	no idea what it costs to run one of those
	large yachts! It must have made an
	inroad even in his large fortune. He
	has been a friend indeed!”</p>

	<p>Deena turned away her face; it was
	hard for her to praise Stephen, although
	her heart echoed her husband’s words.</p>

	<p>“He has high ideals in friendship as
	in everything else,” she answered, “but
	you must remember, Simeon, that the
	thought of your sufferings agonized us
	at home. Who could have abandoned
	you to such a fate? It makes me sick
	to think of it!”</p>

	<p>A sort of shiver passed over him,
	while he said, simply:</p>

	<p>“It was all in the day’s work. French
	ran the same risks, only with better
	luck.” Presently he added:</p>

	<p>“I feel tired, Deena—and a little oppressed.
	Perhaps you had better ring
	the bell—but stay. Will you kiss me
	before you ring?”</p>

	<p>She kissed him with a pity that
	wrung her heart, and he sighed contentedly
	and shut his eyes. He only
	spoke once more, just as the doctor
	came to his bedside.</p>

	<p>“I should have been glad to see the
	old house before I die, but it is just as
	well as it is.”</p>

	<p>He was dying all the afternoon,
	peacefully and gently, and at sunset the
	end came.</p>

	<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="eleven">XI</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Master Richard Shelton sat at the
	foot of his sister’s table dispensing its
	hospitalities chiefly to himself. Through
	some law unknown to science, all dishes
	seemed to gravitate toward the main
	center of Dicky’s trencher, thereby leaving
	the rest of the table comparatively
	bare.</p>

	<p>For eighteen months Master Shelton
	had given Mrs. Ponsonby the advantage
	of his company; not so much through
	volition—albeit, he was well enough
	pleased with his quarters—as through
	submission to paternal authority.</p>

	<p>Conventional ideas are apt to wilt under
	the blight of poverty, and to revive
	under the fuller harvesting of this
	world’s goods, and Mr. Shelton, Sr.,
	who had, in the days of his leanness, let
	Polly run wild with all the college boys
	of Harmouth, became suddenly particular,
	as his bank account fattened, in regard
	to the niceties of conduct in his
	daughters. His scruples even embraced
	Deena; he said she was too young a
	widow to live alone, and a blank sight
	too handsome, and that either she must
	return to the protection of his roof or
	else receive her brother under her own.
	With the docility of the intelligent, she
	accepted his fiat, but chose the evil represented
	by a unit rather than by the
	sum total of family companionship.</p>

	<p>So she and Dicky had lived together
	since the day when Simeon had been
	laid to rest beside his mother in the
	churchyard, and Deena had taken up
	life with such courage as she could muster
	in the old house. She had started
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>out with a long illness, as the result of
	overtaxed nerves, and the nurse who
	had been engaged for Simeon found
	ample employment with Simeon’s widow;
	but a good constitution and a quiet
	mind are excellent helps toward recovery,
	and by September she found herself
	in admirable health.</p>

	<p>Stephen’s energies had been absorbed
	in editing Simeon’s book. He had the
	assistance of the botanical department
	of Harmouth, and the book was produced
	in a manner which would have
	given poor Ponsonby infinite pleasure.
	French spared no expense, especially in
	the color drawings from Simeon’s photographs
	and specimens, which were exceptionally
	valuable. The printing was
	done in Boston, and Stephen was there
	much of the time. During Deena’s illness
	he was glad of an excuse to be
	near enough to get daily reports of her
	progress, but as she became strong and
	resumed the routine of living, so that
	intercourse became unavoidable, he
	found the strain of silence more than he
	could bear. He resigned his professorship
	permanently, and went abroad,
	making the book his excuse. He wished
	to see that it was properly heralded by
	both English and Continental scientific
	periodicals, and he preferred to attend
	to it himself. To say that Deena missed
	him but feebly expresses the void his
	going made in her life, but, knowing her
	own heart, and suspecting the state of
	his, she was glad to be spared his presence
	in these early days of widowhood,
	and could not but approve his decision.</p>

	<p>Dicky’s society was hardly calculated
	to stifle her longings for higher things,
	for his conduct called for constant repression.
	At first he had nearly driven
	her wild by his prying interest in what
	did not concern him, his way of unmasking
	her secret thoughts, his powers
	of seeing round corners, if not through
	sealed envelopes, but as time went on
	she grew fond of his honest boy-nature,
	and learned to laugh at his precocious
	acuteness. Perhaps with Stephen’s departure
	there were fewer occasions for
	her to resent the challenge of his intrusive
	eye. There were, also, alleviations
	coincident with the school year,
	for then she was free from his company
	from the time he slammed the front
	door, at five minutes to nine, till he returned
	at two, ravenous for dinner.</p>

	<p>On the particular morning indicated
	at the beginning of the chapter, the season
	was the late autumn—the clock was
	pointing ominously near nine—the lady
	opposite to Master Shelton looked more
	beautiful than ever in her widow’s
	weeds. Dicky conveyed half a sausage
	and a wedge of buttered toast to the
	sustenance of boyhood before he asked—with
	some difficulty, if the truth were
	confessed:</p>

	<p>“May I take a bunch of grapes to
	school, Deena?”</p>

	<p>She was about to give a cheerful consent,
	when he defeated his own ends by
	adding:</p>

	<p>“None of the other boys have hothouse
	grapes; it makes ’em think a lot
	of me. I guess they know where they
	come from, too!”</p>

	<p>“In those circumstances, certainly
	not,” she answered, indignantly. “You
	can eat all you like at home.”</p>

	<p>“Well, I call that low-down mean,”
	he said, stabbing another sausage, “and
	you gettin’ all the fruit and flowers
	from Mr. French’s place sent to you
	every day. I wish Polly and Ben were
	there still—they wouldn’t begrudge me
	a little fruit.”</p>

	<p>Polly and Ben had taken Stephen’s
	place for the summer, during his protracted
	absence, and had but recently
	returned to New York.</p>

	<p>“Polly and Ben would despise your
	snobbishness just as I do; besides, I do
	not approve of your taking eatables to
	school,” she added, disingenuously, for
	her objection was to furnishing food for
	Harmouth gossip—not to Dicky.</p>

	<p>“Oh, pshaw!” he exclaimed. “As if
	I didn’t know why you won’t let me
	take ’em! Mr. French will give me
	anything I ask for when he gets home—that’s
	one comfort. Did you know he
	may be here any day? The man who
	brought the flowers told me so yesterday.”</p>

	<p>Deena’s complexion flushed a lively
	pink, or else it was the reflection from
	the wood fire, leaping in tongues of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>flame behind the tall brass fender. She
	certainly looked singularly girlish as she
	sat behind the array of Ponsonby breakfast
	silver, her severe black frock, with
	the transparent bands of white at throat
	and wrists, only serving to mark her
	youthful freshness. Her beauty was of
	little consequence to her brother, who
	was busy considering the advantages
	that might accrue to himself from
	Stephen’s return.</p>

	<p>“When Mr. French went away, he
	said I could ride his saddle horse, and
	though I’ve been there half a dozen
	times since Ben left, that old beast of
	a coachman won’t let me inside the stable.
	Will you tell Mr. French when he
	comes home what an old puddin’ head
	he’s got to look after his horses? The
	man ought to be kicked out!”</p>

	<p>“I shall hardly venture to complain
	to Mr. French about his servants,” said
	Deena.</p>

	<p>“You might be good-natured,” he
	urged; “here’s the whole autumn gone
	without my getting any riding, and Mr.
	French would do anything you
	asked——”</p>

	<p>“It is time for you to go to school,”
	said Deena, shortly.</p>

	<p>“No, it isn’t; not for three minutes
	yet,” he contradicted. “‘Tenny rate, I
	don’t mean to be early this morning—it’s
	jography, and I don’t know my
	lesson; but I do think you might speak
	about the horse, Deena; I never get a
	bit of sport worth countin’”—this in a
	high, grumbling minor. “There was
	Ben; he had his automobile here the
	whole summer, and never offered it to
	me once! The fellows all think it was
	awfully mean—I had promised to take
	them out in it, and it made me feel
	deuced cheap, I can tell you. The idea
	of using a machine like that just to air
	a kid every day! I guess it pumped it
	full of wind, anyhow—that’s one comfort.”</p>

	<p>“If you are going to say disagreeable
	things about the baby, I won’t
	listen to you,” said Deena, crossly, and
	then, ashamed of her petulance, added:
	“Run along to school, dear; the sooner
	you get some knowledge into that little
	red head of yours, the sooner you can
	have automobiles and horses of your
	own.”</p>

	<p>“Those of my brothers-in-law will
	suit me just as well,” he said, favoring
	her with a horrid grimace, as he wiped
	his mouth on a rope of napkin held taut
	between his outstretched fists. “Perhaps
	I had better let Mr. French know
	myself what I expect in the future.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps you’ll mind your own business!”
	cried Deena, driven to fury.</p>

	<p>He left the room singing in a quavering
	treble:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>I’ll pray for you when on the stormy ocean</p>
			<p>With love’s devotion. That’s what I’ll do.</p>
		</div>
	</blockquote>

	<p>It was a song with which a nursemaid
	of the Shelton children had been
	wont to rock the reigning baby to sleep,
	and had lurked in Dicky’s memory for
	many a year.</p>

	<p>Poor Deena was thoroughly ruffled.
	It was maddening to have a love she
	held as the most sacred secret of her
	heart vulgarized by a boy’s coarse teasing,
	and, in addition, she was jealous of
	her own dignity—anxious to pay her
	dead husband proper respect—distressed
	at the possibility of Stephen’s
	thoughtful kindness becoming a subject
	of comment in the town. And yet
	what difference did it make?</p>

	<p>This carefully guarded secret would
	be public property by her own consent
	before a week was over, for Dicky’s announcement
	of French’s return was no
	news to Deena—at that very moment
	her heart was beating against a letter
	which assured her he was following
	fast upon its tracks, and when he came
	he was not likely to prove a patient
	lover. All through that second summer
	his letters had been growing more
	tender, more urgent, till at last he had
	taken matters into his own hands, and
	decided that their separation must end.
	For aught she knew, his vessel might
	already have reached New York—he
	might be that blessed moment on his
	way to Harmouth! The thought sent
	little thrills of happiness bounding
	through her veins. She had a shrewd
	idea he would appear unannounced by
	letter or telegram, but not to-day—certainly
	not to-day—she reflected.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>There were plenty of small duties
	waiting for her that morning, but in
	woman’s parlance she “couldn’t settle to
	anything”; there was an excitement in
	her mood that demanded the freedom of
	fresh air. She went up to her bedroom
	and stood for a moment at her window
	before yielding to the impulse that beckoned
	her out into the sunshine; and,
	drawing Stephen’s letter from her dress,
	she read it once more, to make sure she
	had missed no precious hint as to the
	time of his sailing. He wrote:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>May I come back? You must know all I
		mean that to imply—to come back, my best
		beloved, to you—to order my life in accordance
		to your pleasure—to marry you the day
		I set foot in Harmouth—or to wait impatiently
		till you are pleased to give yourself
		to me. I trust your love too entirely to fear
		that you will needlessly prolong the time.
		You are too fair-minded to let mere conventions
		weigh with you as against my happiness.
		Between you and me there must be
		no shams, and yet I would not shock or
		hurry you for the world.</p>

		<p>On second thoughts, I shall not wait for
		your permission to return—that is not the
		best way to gain one’s desires! No, I shall
		come before you can stop me, and while you
		are saying to yourself, “Perhaps he is on
		the ocean,” I may be turning in at your gate.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>What did she mean to do? she asked
	herself, with a smile that was its own
	answer.</p>

	<p>She went into her closet, and, fetching
	her crape hat from the shelf, began
	pinning it on before the glass. Its somber
	ugliness accorded ill with the brightness
	of her hair, and somehow her hair
	seemed to turn mourning into a mockery.</p>

	<p>She couldn’t help recalling an incident
	that had happened two years before,
	when she had seen herself in that
	same glass transformed into sudden
	prettiness by Polly’s skillful fingers, and
	how her pleasure in her appearance
	had been turned into humiliation by
	Simeon’s petty tyranny, when she
	asked him to pay for her hat. And
	then she was ashamed of her own
	thoughts—distressed that she had let
	the paltry reminiscence force itself into
	her mind; for great happiness should
	put us in charity with all. Never again
	would she allow an unkind remembrance
	to lodge in her thoughts.</p>

	<p>She shut the door of her room and
	hurried out into the street—there was
	so much indoors to remind her of what
	she most wished to forget. When
	Stephen came for her they would go
	away from Harmouth—just for a little
	while, till the memories faded—and,
	in a future of perfect love, think kindly,
	gratefully, pitifully, of Simeon.</p>

	<p>You see, she was desperately in love,
	poor child, and at last heart and conscience
	were in accord.</p>

	<p>Her feet fairly danced up the street;
	she moved so lightly she hardly rustled
	the carpet of fallen leaves that overspread
	the pavement. It was a glorious
	day, the sun was touching all prosaic
	things with gold, and up in heaven,
	against the interminable blue, little
	white clouds sailed in dapples, such as
	Raphael charged with angel faces, and
	every face seemed to smile.</p>

	<p>Wandering across the campus, under
	the stately arches of the college elms,
	she finally reached the open country,
	and, realizing that even the wings of
	happiness are mortal, she turned homeward,
	choosing the avenue that led past
	French’s place. Perhaps she hoped for
	reassuring signs of his coming—doors
	and windows thrown open and gardeners
	at work upon the ground—but before
	she got beyond the high hedge
	that cut off her view, a carriage, which
	she recognized as Stephen’s, drove rapidly
	toward the gate, and in it sat a
	lady, stately and grand, but so closely
	veiled as to defy both sun and curiosity.
	At a sign from her the carriage stopped,
	and a voice exclaimed:</p>

	<p>“I have just been to see you, Mrs.
	Ponsonby, and was so much disappointed
	to find you out—and so was
	some one else, I fancy, who I am sure
	has been at your house this morning!
	Pray get in and drive home with me.
	And I will send you back to town after
	you have paid me a little visit.”</p>

	<p>Deena had by this time recognized
	Mrs. Star, and recovered sufficiently
	from her surprise to take the offered
	seat in the carriage, but she was in such
	a tumult of hope and fear she hardly
	dared trust herself to do more than
	greet her old friend. Mrs. Star understood
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>quite well, and gave her time to
	recover her wits by a characteristic
	harangue.</p>

	<p>“How am I?” she repeated, sardonically.
	“Lame for life! I have never
	got over McTorture’s treatment, and
	never shall. Oh, no, it was not the
	original accident—that was an innocent
	affair—it is the result of McTorture’s
	nonsense in keeping me chained
	to my sofa in one position till my leg
	stiffened. But never mind about doctors;
	they’re all alike—bad’s the best!
	You look handsome and healthy enough
	to keep out of their clutches; tell me all
	about yourself.”</p>

	<p>“There is never anything to tell about
	me,” said Deena. “I am much more
	concerned to know why you are here.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star’s eyes softened.</p>

	<p>“Because Stephen wouldn’t stop long
	enough in New York for me to exchange
	ten words with him, and so I
	did the next best thing—indeed, the
	only thing I could do to satisfy my
	affection—I came with him; and upon
	my word, I do not think he wanted me!
	Now, how do you account for that,
	Mrs. Deena?”</p>

	<p>Her expression was so insinuating
	that Deena might be excused a slight
	irritation in her tone as she answered:</p>

	<p>“I don’t account for it.”</p>

	<p>Here they reached the front door, for
	the approach was a short one, and Mrs.
	Star got out laboriously and ushered
	her guest into the hall.</p>

	<p>“Do you know your way to the library?”
	she asked. “It is on the other
	side of this barn of a room, and if you
	will make yourself comfortable there,
	I will join you in a minute. The truth
	is, we are not in order, and I must give
	a message before I can have the conscience
	to sit down and enjoy a chat.”</p>

	<p>Deena’s eyes were still blinded by the
	midday glare, but she managed to cross
	the great drawing room without stumbling
	over an ottoman, and, pushing
	aside the heavy curtain that shut off the
	library, she walked directly into Stephen’s
	arms.</p>

	<p>As Mrs. Star saw fit to leave her undisturbed,
	it would be sheer presumption
	for a humble person like the writer
	to disregard that compelling example.
	Suffice it to say that for one hour
	Stephen’s horses stamped and champed
	in the stable, and that when finally Mrs.
	Star did appear, the occupants of the
	library were under the impression she
	had been gone barely long enough to
	take off her wraps.</p>

	<p>Perhaps no mortals deserve happiness,
	and certainly few attain it, but if
	ever a man and a woman were likely
	to find satisfaction in each other’s companionship,
	it was the lovers sitting
	hand in hand before Stephen’s fire.</p>

	<p>Most women of twenty-four have had
	some experience of love as a passion;
	they have known its fullness or its
	blight, or more often still, they have
	frittered it away in successive flirtations,
	but with Deena it had come as a
	revelation and been consecrated to one.
	To be sure, she had tried to crush and
	repress it, but it had persisted because
	of its inherent force. And with Stephen
	the passion was at once the delight and
	glory of his life. His was no boy’s love
	made up of sentiment and vanity; he
	had brought a man’s courage to follow
	duty to the borders of despair, and all
	the while he held the image of her he
	loved unsullied in his heart. At last
	they were free to take all that life had
	before withheld of sympathy and friendship
	and perfect understanding. What
	wonder that an hour should slip away
	before they realized the flight of time?</p>

	<p>Mrs. Star received her nephew’s announcement
	with suitable effusion, and
	with an undercurrent of genuine feeling.
	After kissing Deena, she made a
	confidence that had a spice of kindly
	malice.</p>

	<p>“My dear child,” she said, “I knew
	so well what was about to happen, that
	I came all the way from New York in
	order to welcome you into the family,
	and I think I showed great self-restraint
	not to tell you so in the carriage when
	you put that very direct question as to
	what brought me.”</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap2.png" width="126" height="120" alt="W" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">When</span> Dickie’s mother
	put him in my charge
	for the summer she
	said: “Keep him out
	of as much mischief
	as you can.” This
	seemed unnecessary,
	for, really, Dickie was a well-mannered,
	good-looking young fellow, with broad
	shoulders, a clear skin and a clean heart.
	I said as much.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you old bachelors!” laughed
	Dickie’s mother, and sailed away to
	spend her second season of widowhood
	abroad.</p>

	<p>Dickie and I were just taking a look
	at the country surrounding our summer
	headquarters when we found Rosie.
	Balancing herself on a gatepost and
	eating cherries was Rosie. It must be
	admitted that she did both of these
	things with a certain grace, also that
	the picture she made had its charm.
	For she was probably sixteen, with all
	that the age implies.</p>

	<p>Of course, one could not expect
	Dickie to be at all impressed. Certainly
	I did not.</p>

	<p>“Girls!” Here followed an ominous
	inbreathing, ending in an explosive
	“Huh!” This was Dickie’s expressed
	attitude toward the sex. For Dickie
	was nineteen, which is the scornful age,
	you know. What are girls when a fellow
	is going to be a soph. in the fall,
	with the prospect of playing quarterback
	on the ’varsity eleven?</p>

	<p>As we neared the girl on the gatepost
	Dickie gave her a careless glance. She
	certainly deserved better. There was
	the sifting sunshine in her hair and
	there were her white, rounded arms
	reaching up to pull down a fruit-laden
	branch. Perhaps the girl on the gatepost
	felt the slight of Dickie’s unappreciative
	glance, perhaps not. At any
	rate, she was unstirred.</p>

	<p>“Want one?” she asked, saucily
	dangling a cherry at us.</p>

	<p>Red as the cherry went Dickie’s face,
	and he marched stiffly past without reply.
	Once we were out of earshot, he
	remarked, with deep disgust: “What a
	freshy!”</p>

	<p>“Yes, but rather pretty,” said I.</p>

	<p>“Think so? Now, I don’t.” This
	with the air of a connoisseur. “But she
	did have good eyes.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” I agreed. “I like brown ones
	myself.”</p>

	<p>“Brown?” protested Dickie. “They
	were blue, dark blue and big—the deep
	kind.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, were they?” In my tone must
	have been that which caused Dickie to
	suspect that I was teasing him.</p>

	<p>“You bet she knows it, too,” he
	added, vindictively. “Conceited beggars,
	these girls.”</p>

	<p>“Awfully,” I assented. Then, after a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>pause: “But I thought you were fond
	of cherries?”</p>

	<p>“So I am. If she’d been a boy, I
	would have tried to buy a quart.”</p>

	<p>“She seemed to want you to have
	some,” I suggested. “Perhaps she
	would sell you a few.”</p>

	<p>Dickie glanced at me suspiciously.
	“Think so? I’ve a mind to go back and
	try. Will you wait?”</p>

	<p>I said I would; in fact, it was the only
	thing to be done, for he was off. So I
	sat down and watched the scorner of
	girls disappear eagerly around a bend
	in the road. At the end of a half hour
	of waiting I began to speculate. Had
	Dickie’s courage failed him, had he
	taken to the woods, or was he upbraiding
	her of the gatepost for the sin of
	conceit? I would go and see for myself.</p>

	<p>All unheeding the rest of the world,
	they were sitting at the foot of the cherry
	tree. The “conceited beggar” of the
	deep blue eyes was trying to toss cherries
	into Dickie’s open mouth. When
	she missed it became Dickie’s turn to
	toss cherries. The game was a spirited
	one. Dickie appeared to be well entertained.</p>

	<p>“I thought you had forgotten me,”
	said I, mildly. Dickie’s laugh broke
	square in the middle, and he smoothed
	his face into a bored expression.</p>

	<p>“Her name is Rosie,” this was the
	substance of the stammered introduction.</p>

	<p>“Indeed!” I replied. “And you were
	right about her eyes; they <em>are</em> blue.”</p>

	<p>Dickie flushed guiltily and hastily got
	on his feet.</p>

	<p>“Come on,” he said; “I guess we’d
	better be going.”</p>

	<p>Very frankly Rosie looked her opinion
	of me as we left. It was interesting
	to note the elaborate strategy used
	by Dickie to conceal the fact that he
	waved his handkerchief to her. There
	ensued a long silence between us, but
	of this Dickie seemed unconscious. He
	broke it by whistling “Bedelia” two
	notes off the key.</p>

	<p>“It’s too bad, Dickie,” I said, finally,
	“that you dislike girls so much.”</p>

	<p>“They’re a silly lot,” said Dickie, with
	a brave effort at a tired drawl.</p>

	<p>“But Rosie, now——”</p>

	<p>“Oh, she’s not like the rest of them.
	She’s rather jolly.”</p>

	<p>“Conceited little beggar, though, I
	suppose?”</p>

	<p>“No, sir; not a bit. She’s just the
	right kind.” Then Dickie flushed and
	the conversation lapsed suddenly.</p>

	<p>We were to go sailing on the river
	next morning, but when the time came
	Dickie pleaded delay. He had “promised
	to take a book to a friend.” He
	would be back in a few minutes. Two
	hours did Dickie take for that errand,
	and I began to think that perhaps my
	joking had been unwise.</p>

	<p>Dickie now entered upon a chronic
	state of being “togged up.” He treasured
	faded flowers, raising hue and cry
	because the maid threw out a wilted
	peony which he had enshrined in a vase
	on his chiffonier. Once he almost fell
	into the river rescuing an envelope
	which had slipped from his pocket. The
	treasure it contained seemed to be a
	lock of dark hair. His spending money
	went for fancy chocolates, which I did
	not see him eat.</p>

	<p>Such were the beginnings of this tremendous
	affair.</p>

	<p>Very gentle and serious Dickie became
	in these days, moods new to him.
	Also he took to reading poetry. Scott’s
	“Marmion,” about the only piece of
	verse with which he had been on speaking
	acquaintance, he abandoned for
	fragments of “Locksley Hall” and “Lucille.”
	His musical taste underwent
	like change. The rollicking college airs
	he was accustomed to whistle with more
	vigor than accuracy gave place to “Tell
	Me, Pretty Maiden,” and “Annie
	Laurie.” These he executed quite as
	inaccurately, but—and this was some
	relief—in minor key.</p>

	<p>Sitting in the sacred hush of the
	moonlight, we had long talks on sober
	subjects not at all related to “revolving
	wedges” and “guards back formation,”
	on which he had been wont to discourse.
	With uneasy conscience I meditated on
	the amazing alchemy, potent in young
	and tender passion.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>One morning a grinning youngster
	with big blue eyes, like Rosie’s, handed
	me a note. It was rather sticky to the
	touch, by reason of the candy with
	which the messenger had been paid. It
	bore no address. “Darlingest Dearest——”
	Thus far I read, then folded
	it promptly and put it in my pocket.</p>

	<p>The note was still there the next afternoon
	when, jibing our sail, we came
	abruptly on an unexpected scene. In a
	smart cedar rowboat, such as they have
	for hire at the summer hotel, an athletic
	youth wielded a pair of long, spruce
	oars. Facing him, with her back toward
	us and leaning comfortably
	against the chair seat in the stern, was
	a pretty girl in white.</p>

	<p>“Why,” said I, with perhaps a suspicion
	of relief, “I believe that is Rosie.”</p>

	<p>Dickie, gripping the tiller hard, was
	staring as one in a trance. My words
	roused him.</p>

	<p>“Rosie? What Rosie?” said he.</p>

	<p>“Why, the one who gave you the
	cherries.”</p>

	<p>“Is it?” asked Dickie, stoically. Then,
	with studied carelessness and devilish
	abandon: “I say, old man, toss me a
	cigar, will you? I feel like having a
	smoke.”</p>

	<p>After dinner I found Dickie in his
	room. There was a scent of burned paper
	in the air and fresh ashes were in
	the grate. The mercury was close to
	ninety.</p>

	<p>“Chilly?” said I.</p>

	<p>Dickie laughed unconvincingly. “No,
	just burning some old trash. Want to
	take a tramp?”</p>

	<p>I did. Was it chance or the immutable
	workings of fate which took us in
	time past the house of the cherry tree?
	In a porch hammock was Rosie, a vision
	of budding beauty only half clouded
	in flimsy lawn and lace. Yet with never
	a turn of the head Dickie swaggered
	by, talking meanwhile to me in tones
	meant to carry an idea of much light-heartedness.
	Over my shoulder I noted
	that Rosie was standing watching us,
	a puzzled look on her face.</p>

	<p>“Dick!” It was rather a faint call,
	but loud enough to be heard.</p>

	<p>“She’s calling you,” said I.</p>

	<p>“Wait, Dickie!” This time there was
	an aggrieved, pleading note, against
	which the stern Dickie was not proof.</p>

	<p>“Well,” said he, “I suppose I’d better
	see what she wants. Will you wait?”</p>

	<p>“No, I will go on slowly and you can
	catch up with me. Don’t be long,
	Dickie.”</p>

	<p>But a full hour later, when I returned,
	he was just starting. From
	some distance up the road I could see
	them. On the veranda Rosie’s mother
	rocked and worked placidly away at
	something in her lap. Quite sedately
	they walked down the path until a big
	hydrangea bush, studded thickly with
	great clumps of blossoms, screened
	them from the house. Then something
	occurred which told me that the boating
	incident and the unanswered note
	had either been forgiven or forgotten. I
	dodged out of sight behind a hedge.
	When I thought it safe to come out,
	Dickie was swinging up the road toward
	me, whistling furiously. Clawing
	my shoulder, he remarked: “Say, old
	man, what do you think of her?”</p>

	<p>“Think of whom?”</p>

	<p>“Why, Rosie.”</p>

	<p>“Rosie! What Rosie? Oh, you
	mean the one who gave you the cherries?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, of course. Say”—this impulsively
	in my ear—“she’s the sweetest
	girl alive.”</p>

	<p>“From what I saw just now,” said I,
	“I should say that you were quite competent
	to pass on Rosie’s flavor. You
	took at least two tastes.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t care if you did see,” said
	Dickie. “Suppose you can keep a secret? We’re en——”</p>

	<p>“You young scamp!” I exclaimed.
	Visions of an ambitious and angry
	mother came to me with abrupt vividness.
	“You don’t mean to tell me that
	you two——”</p>

	<p>“Yep, we are. But no one is to know
	of it until I’ve graduated.”</p>

	<p>Interesting news for me, wasn’t it?
	Well, by means of discreet deception
	and the use of such diplomacy as would
	have settled a dispute between nations,
	I dragged Dickie far away that very
	night. Moreover, although it was the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>most difficult and thankless task I had
	ever undertaken, I kept him away until
	I had seen him safely bestowed in a college
	dormitory. There I left him constructing,
	in defiance of all the good
	advice I had given him, an elaborate
	missive to a person whom he addressed
	as “My Darling Rosie.” Then I knew
	that I might as well give up. Sorrowfully
	I recalled the words of a forgotten
	sentimentalist: “It is on the deep
	pages of the heart that Youth writes indelibly
	its salutary to Cupid.”</p>

	<p>When I met Dickie’s mother at the
	pier in October, I expected to hear that
	he had written all about my wicked interference
	in the Rosie affair. He
	hadn’t, though, and I shamelessly accepted
	her thanks, wondering all the
	while what she would say when the
	shocking truth came out. Her Dickie
	engaged! And to a nameless nobody!
	It would not be pleasant to face Dickie’s
	mother after she had acquired this
	knowledge.</p>

	<p>So at the end of the term I was on
	hand to help Dickie pack his trunk,
	meaning to save him, by hook or crook,
	from his precocious entanglement. I
	should try reason first, then ridicule,
	and, lastly, I would plead with him, as
	humbly as I might, to forget.</p>

	<p>This program I did not carry out. On
	the mantel in Dickie’s room, propped
	against a tobacco jar, was a photograph
	of a girl with fluffy hair and pouting
	lips. Observing that Dickie wrapped
	the picture carefully in a sweater before
	tucking it away in his trunk, I
	asked: “Who is that, Dickie?”</p>

	<p>“Met her at the Junior hop,” said
	Dickie. “She’s a queen, all right.”</p>

	<p>“Indeed!” Then I added, anxiously:
	“And what of Rosie?”</p>

	<p>“Rosie?” Could this blankness on
	Dickie’s face be genuine? “What Rosie?”</p>

	<p>“Why, the one who gave you the
	cherries.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, <em>that</em> one!” Dickie laughed
	lightly. “Why, that’s all off long ago,
	you know.”</p>

	<p>Right there I abandoned all faith in
	a sentimental theory having to do with
	Cupid and certain pages in the heart of
	Youth.</p>

	<h2>AN EDITORIAL</h2>

	<p class="subtitle">SYNOPSIS OF CHAPTERS <abbr title="one to thirteen">I—XIII</abbr> OF “THE DELUGE,” BY DAVID GRAHAM PHILLIPS</p>

	<p>Matthew Blacklock, the central figure of the story, is essentially a self-made man, who has made
	himself a power to be reckoned with. He is a man of great natural force, immense egotism, insatiable
	greed for notoriety and unswerving adherence to his own standards of morality. He has two devouring
	ambitions: First to become one of the inner circle that controls high finance and second to become
	one of the elect in society.</p>

	<p>The opening chapters explain these ambitions. The magnate of the financial world is Roebuck,
	who has from time to time made use of Blacklock’s peculiar abilities and following. The latter has
	become impatient and dissatisfied with his role as a mere instrument and demands of Roebuck that
	he shall be given a place among the “seats of the mighty.” Roebuck makes a pretense of yielding to
	the demand.</p>

	<p>Blacklock’s social ambition is awakened and stimulated by his meeting with Anita Ellersly, the
	sister of a young society man who has been the recipient of many financial favors from Blacklock.</p>

	<p>The latter finally succeeds in his wish so far as to receive an invitation to dinner at the Ellerslys’,
	which is given for reasons that are obvious. It is made plain to him, however, that his intentions with
	respect to Anita are extremely distasteful to her, and after an evening spent under a tremendous nervous
	strain he leaves the house exhausted and depressed.</p>

	<p>His first impulse after his visit to the Ellerslys’ house is to regard his plans as hopeless, but his
	vanity comes to his rescue and strengthens his resolution to succeed. For assistance he turns to Monson,
	the trainer of his racing stable, an Englishman in whom he has discovered unmistakable signs of breeding
	and refinement. Under Monson’s tuition he makes rapid progress in adapting himself to the requirements
	imposed upon aspirants for social distinction.</p>

	<p>His absorption in these pursuits leads to his unconscious neglect of some of the finer points of his
	financial game. He allows himself to be misled by the smooth appearance of the friendliness of Mowbray
	Langdon, one of Roebuck’s trusted lieutenants, and accumulates a heavy short interest in one of his
	pet industrial stocks. He visits Roebuck and is deceived by the latter’s suavity. He has another invitation
	to dine at the Ellerslys’, but his experience is as discouraging as before.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless, having now become hopelessly in love with Anita, he persists in his attentions and
	finally becomes engaged to her, though it is perfectly understood by both that she does not love him
	and accepts him only because he is rich and her family is poor.</p>

	<p>Meantime, he has to some extent lost his hold upon his affairs in Wall Street and suddenly
	awakens to the fact that he has been betrayed by Langdon, who, knowing that Blacklock is deeply involved
	in a short interest in Textile Trust stock, has taken advantage of the latter’s preoccupation with
	Miss Ellersly to boom the price of the stock. With ruin staring him in the face, Blacklock takes energetic
	measures to save himself.</p>

	<p>He makes the startling discovery that Langdon is the person responsible for the rise in Textile,
	the object being to drive him from the Street. He sees Anita, tells her the situation and frees her, but
	she refuses to accept her release when she hears of Langdon’s duplicity.</p>

	<p>With the aid of money loaned to him by a gambler friend, he succeeds the next day, by means
	of large purchases of Textile Trust, in postponing the catastrophe.</p>

	<p>Calling at the house of the Ellerslys’, he has a violent scene with Mrs. Ellersly, who attempts to
	break the engagement between him and Anita, but it ends in his taking her with him from the house.</p>

		<h2>THE DELUGE<br />
		A STORY OF MODERN FINANCE</h2>
		<p class="byline">By David Graham Phillips</p>

	<p class="subtitle">[<a href="#art4">FOR SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS INSTALLMENTS SEE PRECEDING PAGE</a>]</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap5.png" width="118" height="116" alt="A" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">As</span> we neared the upper
	end of the park, I told
	my chauffeur, through
	the tube, to enter and
	go slowly. Whenever
	a lamp flashed in at us,
	I had a glimpse of her
	progress toward composure—now she
	was drying her eyes with the bit of
	lace she called a handkerchief; now her
	bare arms were up, and with graceful
	fingers she was arranging her hair; now
	she was straight and still, the soft,
	fluffy material with which her wrap was
	edged drawn close about her throat. I
	shifted to the opposite seat, for my
	nerves warned me that I could not long
	control myself, if I stayed on where
	her garments were touching me.</p>

	<p>I looked away from her for the pleasure
	of looking at her again, of realizing
	that my overwrought senses were not
	cheating me. Yes, there she was, in all
	the luster of that magnetic beauty I cannot
	think of even now without an up-blazing
	of the fire which is to the heart
	what the sun is to the eyes of a blind
	man dreaming of sight. There she was
	on my side of the chasm that had separated
	us—alone with me—mine—mine!
	And my heart dilated with pride. But
	a moment later came a sense of humility.
	Her beauty intoxicated me, but
	her youth, her fineness, so fragile for
	such rough hands as mine, awed and
	humbled me. “I must be very gentle,”
	said I to myself. “I have promised
	that she shall never regret. God help
	me to keep my promise! She is mine,
	but only to preserve and protect.” And
	that idea of <em>responsibility in possession</em>
	was new to me—was to have far-reaching
	consequences. Now I think it
	changed the whole course of my life.</p>

	<p>She was leaning forward, her elbow
	on the casement of the open window of
	the brougham, her cheek against her
	hand; the moonlight was glistening on
	her round, firm forearm and on her
	serious face. “How far, far away from—everything
	it seems here!” she said,
	her voice tuned to that soft, clear light,
	“and how beautiful it is!” Then, addressing
	the moon and the shadows of
	the trees rather than me: “I wish I
	could go on and on—and never return
	to—to the world.”</p>

	<p>“I wish we could,” said I.</p>

	<p>My tone was low, but she started,
	drew back into the brougham, became
	an outline in the deep shadow. In another
	mood that might have angered
	me. Just then it hurt me so deeply that
	to remember it to-day is to feel a faint
	ache in the scar of the long healed
	wound. My face was not hidden as
	was hers; so, perhaps, she saw. At any
	rate, her voice tried to be friendly as
	she said: “Well—I have crossed the
	Rubicon. And I don’t regret. It was
	silly of me to cry. I thought I had
	been through so much that I was beyond
	such weakness. But you will
	find me calm from now on, and reasonable.”</p>

	<p>“Not too reasonable, please,” said I,
	with an attempt at her lightness. “A
	reasonable woman is as trying as an
	unreasonable man.”</p>

	<p>“But we are going to be sensible with
	each other,” she urged, “like two
	friends. Aren’t we?”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>“We are going to be what we are
	going to be,” said I. “We’ll have to
	take life as it comes.”</p>

	<p>That clumsy reminder set her to
	thinking, stirred her vague uneasiness
	in those strange circumstances to active
	alarm. For presently she said, in a
	tone that was not quite so matter-of-course
	as she would have liked to make
	it: “We’ll go now to my uncle Frank’s.
	He’s a brother of my father. I always
	used to like him best—and still do. But
	he married a woman mamma thought—queer—and
	they hadn’t much—and
	he lives away up on the West Side—One
	Hundred and Twenty-seventh
	Street.”</p>

	<p>“The wise plan, the only wise plan,”
	said I, not so calm as she must have
	thought me, “is to go to my partner’s
	house and send out for a minister.”</p>

	<p>“Not to-night,” she replied, nervously.
	“Take me to uncle Frank’s, and
	to-morrow we can discuss what to do
	and how to do it.”</p>

	<p>“To-night,” I persisted. “We must
	be married to-night. No more uncertainty
	and indecision and weakness.
	Let us begin bravely, Anita!”</p>

	<p>“To-morrow,” she said. “But not
	to-night. I must think it over.”</p>

	<p>“To-night,” I repeated. “To-morrow
	will be full of its own problems.
	This is to-night’s.”</p>

	<p>She shook her head, and I saw that
	the struggle between us had begun—the
	struggle against her timidity and
	conventionality. “No, not to-night.”
	This in her tone for finality.</p>

	<p>To have argued with any woman in
	such circumstances would have been
	dangerous; to have argued with her
	would have been fatal. To reason with
	a woman is to flatter her into suspecting
	you of weakness and herself of
	strength. I told the chauffeur to turn
	about and go slowly uptown. She
	settled back into her corner of the
	brougham. Neither of us spoke until
	we were passing Clairmont. Then she
	started out of her secure confidence in
	my obedience, and exclaimed: “This is
	not the way!” And her voice had in
	it the hasty call-to-arms.</p>

	<p>“No,” I replied, determined to push
	the panic into a rout. “As I told you,
	our future shall be settled to-night.”
	That in <em>my</em> tone for finality.</p>

	<p>A pause, then: “It <em>has</em> been settled,”
	she said, like a child that feels, yet denies,
	its impotence as it struggles in the
	compelling arms of its father. “I
	thought until a few minutes ago that I
	really intended to marry you. Now I
	see that I didn’t.”</p>

	<p>“Another reason why we’re not going
	to your uncle’s,” said I.</p>

	<p>She leaned forward so that I could
	see her face. “I cannot marry you,”
	she said. “I feel humble toward you,
	for having misled you. But it is better
	that you—and I—should have found
	out now than too late.”</p>

	<p>“It <em>is</em> too late—too late to go back.”</p>

	<p>“Would you wish to marry a woman
	who does not love you, who loves some
	one else, and who tells you so and refuses
	to marry you?” She had tried to
	concentrate enough scorn into her voice
	to hide her fear.</p>

	<p>“I would,” said I. “And I shall. I’ll
	not desert you, Anita, when your courage
	and strength fail. I will carry you
	on to safety.”</p>

	<p>“I tell you I cannot marry you,” she
	cried, between appeal and command.
	“There are reasons—I may not tell you.
	But if I might, you would—would take
	me to my uncle’s. I cannot marry
	you!”</p>

	<p>“That is what conventionality bids
	you say now,” I replied. “But what will
	it bid you say to-morrow morning, as
	we drive down crowded Fifth Avenue,
	after a night in this brougham?”</p>

	<p>I could not see her, for she drew back
	into the darkness as sharply as if I had
	struck her with all my force full in the
	face. But I could feel the effect of my
	words upon her. I paused, not because
	I expected or wished an answer, but because
	I had to steady myself—myself,
	not my purpose; my purpose was inflexible.
	I would put through what
	we had begun, just as I would have
	held her and cut off her arm with my
	pocketknife if we had been cast away
	alone, and I had had to do it to save
	her life. She was not competent to decide
	for herself. Every problem that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>had ever faced her had been decided by
	others for her. Who but me could decide
	for her now? I longed to plead
	with her, to show her how I was suffering;
	but I dared not. “She would
	misunderstand,” said I to myself. “She
	would think you were weakening.”</p>

	<p>Full fifteen minutes of that frightful
	silence before she said: “I will go
	where you wish.” And she said it in
	a tone which makes me wince as I recall
	it now.</p>

	<p>I called my partner’s address up
	through the tube. Again that frightful
	silence, then she was trying to choke
	back the sobs. A few words I caught:
	“They have broken my will—they have
	broken my will.”</p>

	<p>Ball lived in a big, graystone house
	that stood apart and commanded a noble
	view of the Hudson and the Palisades.
	It was, in the main, a reproduction
	of a French chateau, and such
	changes as the architect had made in
	his model were not positively disfiguring,
	though amusing. There should
	have been trees and shrubbery about it,
	but—“As Mrs. B. says,” Joe had explained
	to me, “what’s the use of sinking
	a lot of cash in a house people can’t
	see?” So there was not a bush, not a
	flower. Inside—— One day Ball took
	me on a tour of the art shops. “I’ve got
	a dozen corners and other big bare
	spots to fill,” said he. “Mrs. B. hates
	to give up money, haggles over every
	article. I’m going to put the job
	through in business style.” I soon discovered
	that I had been brought along
	to admire his “business style,” not to
	suggest. After two hours, in which he
	bought in small lots about a carload of
	statuary, paintings, vases and rugs, he
	said, “This is too slow.” He pointed his
	stick at a crowded corner of the shop.
	“How much for that bunch of stuff?”
	he demanded. The proprietor gave him
	a figure. “I’ll close,” said Joe, “if you’ll
	give fifteen off for cash.” The proprietor
	agreed. “Now we’re done,”
	said Joe to me. “Let’s go downtown,
	and maybe I can pick up what I’ve
	dropped.”</p>

	<p>You can imagine that interior. But
	don’t picture it as notably worse than
	the interior of the average New York
	palace. It was, if anything, better than
	those houses, where people who deceive
	themselves about their lack of taste
	have taken great pains to prevent anyone
	else from being deceived. One
	could hardly move in Joe’s big rooms
	for the litter of gilded and tapestried
	furniture, and their crowded walls
	made the eyes ache.</p>

	<p>The appearance of the man who
	opened the door for Anita and me suggested
	that our ring had roused him
	from a bed where he had deposited
	himself without bothering to take off
	his clothes. At the sound of my voice,
	Ball peered out of his private smoking
	room, at the far end of the hall. He
	started forward; then, seeing how I
	was accompanied, stopped with mouth
	ajar. He had on a ragged smoking
	jacket, a pair of shapeless old Romeo
	slippers, his ordinary business waistcoat
	and trousers. He was wearing neither
	tie nor collar, and a short, black pipe
	was between his fingers. We had evidently
	caught the household stripped of
	“lugs,” and sunk in the down-at-the-heel
	slovenliness which it called “comfort.”
	Joe was crimson with confusion,
	and was using his free hand to stroke,
	alternately, his shiny bald head and his
	heavy brown mustache. He got himself
	together sufficiently, after a few
	seconds, to disappear into his den.
	When he came out again, pipe and
	ragged jacket were gone, and he rushed
	for us in a gorgeous gray velvet jacket
	with dark red facings, and a showy pair
	of slippers.</p>

	<p>“Glad to see you, Mr. Blacklock”—he
	always addressed every man as Mister
	in his own house, just as “Mrs. B.”
	always called him “Mister Ball,” and
	he called her “Missus Ball” before
	“company.” “Come right into the front
	parlor. Billy, turn on the electric
	lights.”</p>

	<p>Anita had been standing with her
	head down. She now looked round
	with shame and terror in those expressive
	blue-gray eyes of hers; her
	delicate nostrils were quivering. I
	hastened to introduce Ball to her. Her
	impulse to fly passed; her training in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>doing the conventional thing asserted
	itself. She lowered her head again,
	murmured an inaudible acknowledgment
	of Joe’s greeting.</p>

	<p>“Your wife is at home?” said I. If
	one was at home in the evening, the
	other always was also, and both were
	always there, unless they were at some
	theater—except on Sunday night, when
	they dined at Sherry’s, because many
	fashionable people did it. They had
	no friends and few acquaintances. In
	their humbler and happy days they had
	had many friends, but had lost them
	when they moved away from Brooklyn
	and went to live, like uneasy, out-of-place
	visitors, in their grand house, pretending
	to be what they longed to be,
	longing to be what they pretended to be,
	and as discontented as they deserved.</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes, Mrs. B.’s at home,” Joe
	answered. “I guess she and Alva were—about
	to go to bed.” Alva was their
	one child. She had been christened
	Malvina, after Joe’s mother; but when
	the Balls “blossomed out” they renamed
	her Alva, which they somehow
	had got the impression was “smarter.”</p>

	<p>At Joe’s blundering confession that
	the females of the family were in no
	condition to receive, Anita said to me
	in a low voice: “Let us go.”</p>

	<p>I pretended not to hear. “Rout ’em
	out,” said I to Joe. “And then take my
	electric and bring the nearest parson.
	There’s going to be a wedding—right
	here.” And I looked round the long
	salon, with everything draped for the
	summer departure. Joe whisked the
	cover off one chair, his man off another.
	“I’ll have the women folks down
	in two minutes,” he cried. Then to the
	man: “Get a move on you, Billy. Stir
	’em up in the kitchen. Do the best you
	can about supper—and put a lot of
	champagne on the ice. That’s the main
	thing at a wedding.”</p>

	<p>Anita had seated herself listlessly in
	one of the uncovered chairs. The wrap
	slipped back from her shoulders and—how
	proud I was of her! Joe gazed,
	took advantage of her not looking up
	to slap me on the back and to jerk his
	head in enthusiastic approval. Then
	he, too, disappeared.</p>

	<p>A wait, during which we could hear
	through the silence excited undertones
	from the upper floors. The words were
	indistinct until Joe’s heavy voice sent
	down to us an angry “No damn’ nonsense,
	I tell you. Allie’s got to come,
	too. She’s not such a fool as you think.
	Bad example—bosh!”</p>

	<p>Anita started up. “Oh—please—please!”
	she cried. “Take me away—anywhere!
	This is dreadful.”</p>

	<p>It was, indeed, dreadful. If I could
	have had my way at just that moment,
	it would have gone hard with “Mrs. B.”
	and “Allie”—and heavy-voiced Joe, too.
	But I hid my feelings. “There’s nowhere
	else to go,” said I, “except the
	brougham.”</p>

	<p>She sank helplessly into her chair.</p>

	<p>A few minutes more of silence, and
	there was a rustling on the stairs. She
	started up, trembling, looked round, as
	if seeking some way of escape or some
	place to hide. Joe was in the doorway
	holding aside one of the curtains.
	There entered, in a beribboned and beflounced
	tea gown, a pretty, if rather
	ordinary, woman of forty, with a petulant
	baby face. She was trying to look
	reserved and severe. She hardly
	glanced at me before fastening sharp,
	suspicious eyes on Anita.</p>

	<p>“Mrs. Ball,” said I, “this is Miss Ellersly.”</p>

	<p>“Miss Ellersly!” she exclaimed, her
	face changing. And she advanced and
	took both Anita’s hands. “Mr. Ball is
	so stupid,” she went on, with that amusingly
	affected accent which is the “Sunday
	clothes” of speech.</p>

	<p>“I didn’t catch the name, my dear,”
	Joe stammered.</p>

	<p>“Be off,” said I, aside, to him. “Get
	the nearest preacher, and hustle him
	here with his tools.”</p>

	<p>I had one eye on Anita all the time,
	and I saw her gaze follow Joe as he
	hurried out; and her expression made
	my heart ache. I heard him saying in
	the hall, “Go in, Allie. It’s O. K.;”
	heard the door slam, knew we should
	soon have some sort of minister with
	us.</p>

	<p>“Allie” entered the drawing room. I
	had not seen her in six years. I remembered
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>her unpleasantly as a great,
	bony, florid child, unable to stand still
	or to sit still, or to keep her tongue still,
	full of aimless questions and giggles and
	silly remarks, which she and her mother
	thought funny. I saw her now, grown
	into a handsome young woman, with
	enough beauty points for an honorable
	mention, if not for a prize—straight
	and strong and rounded, with a brow
	and a keen look out of the eyes which
	it seemed a pity should be wasted on a
	woman. Her mother’s looks, her father’s
	good sense, a personality got from
	neither, but all her own, and unusual
	and interesting.</p>

	<p>“From what Mr. Ball said,” Mrs.
	Ball was gushing affectedly to Anita,
	“I got an idea, that—well, really, I
	didn’t know <em>what</em> to think.”</p>

	<p>Anita looked as if she were about to
	suffocate. Allie came to the rescue.
	“Not very complimentary to Mr. Blacklock,
	mother,” said she, good-humoredly.
	Then to Anita, with a simple
	friendliness there was no resisting:
	“Wouldn’t you like to come up to my
	room for a few minutes?”</p>

	<p>“Oh, thank you,” responded Anita,
	after a quick but thorough inspection
	of Alva’s face, to make sure she was
	like her voice. I had not counted on
	this; I had been assuming that Anita
	would not be out of my sight until we
	were married. It was on the tip of my
	tongue to interfere when she looked at
	me—for permission to go. “Don’t keep
	her too long,” said I to Alva, and they
	were gone.</p>

	<p>“You can’t blame me—really you
	can’t, Mr. Blacklock,” Mrs. Ball began
	to plead for herself, as soon as they
	were safely out of hearing. “After
	some things—mere hints, you understand—for
	I’m careful what I permit
	Mr. Ball to say before <em>me</em>. I think married
	people cannot be too respectful of
	each other. I <em>never</em> tolerate <em>vulgarity</em>.”</p>

	<p>“No doubt, Joe has made me out a
	very vulgar person,” said I, forgetting
	her lack of sense of humor.</p>

	<p>“Oh, not at all, not at all, Mr. Blacklock,”
	she protested, in a panic lest she
	had done her husband damage with me.
	“I understand, men will be men, though
	as a pure-minded woman, I’m sure I
	can’t imagine why they should be.”</p>

	<p>“How far off is the nearest church?”
	I cut in.</p>

	<p>“Only two blocks—that is, the Methodist
	church,” she replied. “But I know
	Mr. Ball will bring an Episcopalian.”</p>

	<p>“Why, I thought you were a devoted
	Presbyterian,” said I, recalling how
	in their Brooklyn days she used to insist
	on Joe’s going with her twice every
	Sunday to sleep through long sermons.</p>

	<p>She looked uncomfortable. “I was
	reared Presbyterian,” she explained,
	confusedly, “but you know how it is in
	New York. And when we came to
	live here, we got out of the habit of
	churchgoing. And all Alva’s little
	friends were Episcopalians. So I
	drifted toward that church. I find the
	service so satisfying—so—elegant. And—one
	sees there the people one sees
	socially.”</p>

	<p>“How is your culture class?” I inquired,
	deliberately malicious, in my impatience
	and nervousness. “And do
	you still take conversation lessons?”</p>

	<p>She was furiously annoyed. “Oh,
	those old jokes of Joe’s,” she said, affecting
	disdainful amusement.</p>

	<p>In fact, they were anything but
	jokes. On Mondays and Thursdays
	she used to attend a class for women
	who, like herself, wished to be “up-to-date
	on culture and all that sort of
	thing.” They hired a teacher to cram
	them with odds and ends about art and
	politics and the “latest literature, heavy
	and light.” On Tuesdays and Fridays
	she had an “indigent gentlewoman,”
	whatever that may be, come to her to
	teach her how to converse and otherwise
	conduct herself according to the
	“standards of polite society.” Joe used
	to give imitations of those conversation
	lessons that raised roars of laughter
	round the poker table, the louder
	because so many of the other men had
	wives with the same ambitions and the
	same methods of attaining them.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Ball came back to the subject
	of Anita. “I am glad you are going to
	settle with such a charming girl. She
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>comes of such a charming family. I
	have never happened to meet any of
	them. We are in the West Side set,
	you know, while they move in the East
	Side set, and New York is so large
	that one almost never meets anyone
	outside one’s own set.” This smooth
	snobbishness, said in the affected “society”
	tone, was as out of place in her
	as rouge and hair dye in a wholesome,
	honest old grandmother.</p>

	<p>I began to pace the floor. “Can it
	be,” I fretted aloud, “that Joe’s racing
	round looking for an Episcopalian
	preacher, when there was a Methodist
	at hand?”</p>

	<p>“I’m sure he wouldn’t bring anything
	but a Church of England priest,” Mrs.
	Ball assured me, loftily. “Why, Miss
	Ellersly wouldn’t think she was married,
	if she hadn’t a priest of her own
	church.”</p>

	<p>My temper got the bit in its teeth. I
	stopped before her, and fixed her with
	an eye that must have had some fire
	in it. “I’m not marrying a fool, Mrs.
	Ball,” said I. “You mustn’t judge her
	by her bringing up—by her family.
	Children have a way of bringing themselves
	up, in spite of damn fool parents.”</p>

	<p>She weakened so promptly that I was
	ashamed of myself. My only excuse
	for getting out of patience with her is
	that I had seen her seldom in the last
	few years, had forgotten how matter-of-surface
	her affectation and snobbery
	were, and how little they interfered
	with her being a good mother and a
	good wife, up to the limits of her brain
	capacity.</p>

	<p>“I’m sure, Mr. Blacklock,” she said,
	plaintively, “I only wished to say what
	was pleasant and nice about your
	fiancée. I know she’s a lovely girl.
	I’ve often admired her at the opera.
	She goes a great deal in Mrs. Langdon’s
	box, and Mrs. Langdon and I are
	together on the board of managers of
	the Magdalene Home, and also on the
	board of the Hospital for Unfortunate
	Gentlefolk.” And so on, and on.</p>

	<p>I walked up and down among those
	wrapped-up, ghostly chairs and tables
	and cabinets and statues many times
	before Joe arrived with the minister—and
	he was a Methodist, McCabe by
	name. You should have seen Mrs.
	Ball’s look as he advanced his portly
	form and round face with its shaven
	upper lip into the drawing room. She
	tried to be cordial, but she couldn’t—her
	mind was on Anita, and the horror
	which would fill her when she discovered
	that she was to be married by a
	preacher of a sect unknown to fashionable
	circles.</p>

	<p>“All I ask of you,” said I, “is that
	you cut it as short as possible. Miss
	Ellersly is tired and nervous.” This
	while we were shaking hands after Joe’s
	introduction.</p>

	<p>“You can count on me, sir,” said McCabe,
	giving my hand an extra shake
	before dropping it. “I’ve no doubt,
	from what my young neighbor here tells
	me, that your marriage is already made
	in your hearts and with all solemnity.
	The form is an incident—important, but
	only an incident.”</p>

	<p>I liked that, and I liked his unaffected
	way of saying it. His voice had
	more of the homely, homelike, rural
	twang in it than I had heard in New
	York in many a day. I mentally added
	fifty dollars to the fee I had intended to
	give him. And now Anita and Alva
	were coming down the stairway. I was
	amazed at sight of her. Her evening
	dress had given place to a pretty blue
	street suit with a short skirt—white
	showing at her wrists, at her neck and
	through slashings in the coat over her
	bosom; and on her head was a hat to
	match. I looked at her feet—the slippers
	had been replaced by boots. “And
	they’re just right for her,” said Alva,
	who was following my glance, “though
	I’m not so tall as she.”</p>

	<p>But what amazed me most, and delighted
	me, was that Anita seemed to
	be almost in good spirits. It was evident
	she had formed with Joe’s daughter
	one of those sudden friendships so
	great and so vivid that they rarely live
	long after the passing of the heat of the
	emergency which bred them. Mrs. Ball
	saw it, also, and was straightway giddied
	into a sort of ecstasy. You can imagine
	the visions it conjured. I’ve no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>doubt she talked house on the east side
	of the park to Joe that very night, before
	she let him sleep. However, Anita’s
	face was serious enough when we
	took our places before the minister, with
	his little, black-bound book open. And
	as he read in a voice that was genuinely
	impressive those words that no voice
	could make unimpressive, I watched
	her, saw her paleness blanch into pallor,
	saw the dusk creep round her eyes until
	they were like stars waning somberly
	before the gray face of dawn.
	When they closed and her head began
	to sway, I steadied her with my arm.
	And so we stood, I with my arm round
	her, she leaning lightly against my
	shoulder. Her answers were mere
	movements of the lips.</p>

	<p>At the end, when I kissed her cheek,
	she said: “Is it over?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” McCabe answered—she was
	looking at him. “And I wish you all
	happiness, Mrs. Blacklock.”</p>

	<p>She stared at him with great wondering
	eyes. Her form relaxed. I carried
	her to a chair. Joe came with a glass of
	champagne; she drank some of it, and
	it brought life back to her face, and
	some color. With a naturalness that
	deceived even me for the moment, she
	smiled up at Joe as she handed him the
	glass. “Is it bad luck,” she asked, “for
	me to be the first to drink my own
	health?” And she stood, looking tranquilly
	at everyone—except me.</p>

	<p>I took McCabe into the hall and paid
	him off. When we came back, I said:
	“Now we must be going.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, but surely you’ll stay for supper!”
	cried Joe’s wife.</p>

	<p>“No,” replied I, in a tone which
	made it impossible to insist. “We appreciate
	your kindness, but we’ve imposed
	on it enough.” And I shook
	hands with her and with Allie and the
	minister, and, linking Joe’s arm in mine,
	made for the door. I gave the necessary
	directions to my chauffeur while
	we were waiting for Anita to come
	down the steps. Joe’s daughter was
	close beside her, and they kissed each
	other good-by, Alva on the verge of
	tears, Anita not suggesting any emotion
	of any sort. “To-morrow—sure,”
	Anita said to her. And she answered:
	“Yes, indeed—as soon as you telephone
	me.” And so we were off, a shower of
	rice rattling on the roof of the brougham—the
	slatternly manservant had
	thrown it from the midst of the group
	of servants.</p>

	<p>Neither of us spoke. I watched her
	face without seeming to do so, and by
	the light of occasional street lamps saw
	her studying me furtively. At last she
	said: “I wish to go to my uncle’s now.”</p>

	<p>“We are going home,” said I.</p>

	<p>“But the house will be shut up,” said
	she, “and everyone will be in bed. It’s
	nearly midnight. Besides, they might
	not——” She came to a full stop.</p>

	<p>“We are going home,” I repeated.
	“To the Willoughby.”</p>

	<p>She gave me a look that was meant
	to scorch—and it did. But I showed at
	the surface no sign of how I was wincing
	and shrinking.</p>

	<p>She drew further into her corner, and
	out of its darkness came, in a low voice:
	“How I <em>hate</em> you!” like the whisper of
	a bullet.</p>

	<p>I kept silent until I had control of
	myself. Then, as if talking of a matter
	which had been finally and amicably settled,
	I began: “The apartment isn’t exactly
	ready for us, but Joe’s just about
	now telephoning my man that we are
	coming, and telephoning your people to
	send your maid down there.”</p>

	<p>“I wish to go to my uncle’s,” she repeated.</p>

	<p>“My wife will go with me,” said I,
	quietly and gently. “I am considerate
	of her, not of <em>her</em> unwise impulses.”</p>

	<p>A long pause, then from her, in icy
	calmness: “I am in your power just
	now, but I warn you that, if you do not
	take me to my uncle’s, you will wish you
	had never seen me.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve wished that many times already,”
	said I, sadly. “I’ve wished it
	from the bottom of my heart this whole
	evening, when step by step fate has
	been forcing me  on to do things that
	are even more hateful to me than to
	you. For they not only make me hate
	myself, but make you hate me, too.” I
	laid my hand on her arm and held it
	there, though she tried to draw away.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>“Anita,” I said, “I would do anything
	for you—live for you, die for you. But
	there’s that something inside me—you’ve
	felt it—and when it says ‘must,’
	I can’t disobey—you know I can’t. And,
	though you might break my heart, you
	could not break that will. It’s as much
	your master as it is mine.”</p>

	<p>“We shall see—to-morrow,” she said.</p>

	<p>“Do not put me to the test,” I pleaded.
	Then I added what I knew to be true:
	“But you will not. You know it would
	take some one stronger than your uncle,
	stronger than your parents, to drive
	me from what I believe right for you
	and for me.” From the moment that I
	found the bogy of conventionality potent
	enough with her to frighten her
	into keeping her word and marrying me,
	I had no fear for “to-morrow.” The
	hour when she could defy me had
	passed.</p>

	<p>A long, long silence, the electric
	speeding southward under the arching
	trees of the West Drive. I remember it
	was as we skirted the lower end of the
	Mall that she said evenly: “You have
	made me hate you so that it terrifies me.
	I am afraid of the consequences that
	must come to you and to me.”</p>

	<p>“And well you may be,” I answered,
	gently. “For you’ve seen enough of
	me to get at least a hint of what I
	would do, if you drove me to it. Hate
	is terrible, Anita, but love can be more
	terrible.”</p>

	<p>At the Willoughby she let me help
	her descend from the electric, waited
	until I sent it away, walked beside me
	into the building. My man, Sanders,
	had evidently been listening for the elevator;
	the door opened without my
	ringing, and there he was, bowing low.
	She acknowledged his welcome with
	that regard for “appearances” which
	training had made instinctive. In the
	center of my—our—drawing-room table
	was a mass of gorgeous roses.
	“Where did you get ’em?” I asked him,
	in an aside.</p>

	<p>“The elevator boy’s brother, sir,” he
	replied, “works in the florist’s shop just
	across the street, next to the church.
	He happened to be downstairs when I
	got your message, sir. So I was able
	to get a few flowers. I’m sorry, sir, I
	hadn’t a little more time.”</p>

	<p>“You’ve done noble,” said I, and I
	shook hands with him warmly.</p>

	<p>Anita was greeting those flowers as
	if they were a friend suddenly appearing
	in a time of need. She turned now
	and beamed on Sanders. “Thank you,”
	she said; “thank you.” And Sanders
	was hers.</p>

	<p>“Anything I can do—ma’am—sir?”
	asked Sanders.</p>

	<p>“Nothing—except send my maid as
	soon as she comes,” she replied.</p>

	<p>“I shan’t need you,” said I.</p>

	<p>“Mr. Monson is still here,” he said,
	lingering. “Shall I send him away, sir,
	or do you wish to see him?”</p>

	<p>“I’ll speak to him myself in a moment,”
	I answered.</p>

	<p>When Sanders was gone, she seated
	herself and absently played with the
	buttons of her glove.</p>

	<p>“Shall I bring Monson?” I asked.
	“You know, he’s my—factotum.”</p>

	<p>“<em>I</em> do not wish to see him,” she answered.</p>

	<p>“You do not like him?” said I.</p>

	<p>After a brief hesitation she answered,
	“No.”</p>

	<p>I restrained a strong impulse to ask
	her why, for instinct told me she had
	some especial reason that somehow concerned
	me. I said merely: “Then I
	shall get rid of him.”</p>

	<p>“Not on my account,” she replied, indifferently.
	“I care nothing about him
	one way or the other.”</p>

	<p>“He goes at the end of his month,”
	said I.</p>

	<p>She was now taking off her gloves.
	“Before your maid comes,” I went on,
	“let me explain about the apartment.
	This room and the two leading out of
	it are yours. My own suit is on the
	other side of our private hall there.”</p>

	<p>She colored high, paled. I saw that
	she did not intend to speak.</p>

	<p>I stood awkwardly, waiting for something
	further to come into my own
	head. “Good-night,” said I, finally,
	bowing as if I were taking leave of a
	formal acquaintance at the end of a formal
	call.</p>

	<p>She did not answer.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>I left the room, closing the door behind
	me. I paused an instant, heard
	the key click in the lock. And I burned
	in a hot flush of shame—shame that she
	should have thought so basely of me.
	For I did not then realize how far
	apart we were, and utterly in the dark,
	each toward the other. I joined Monson
	in my little smoking room. “Congratulate
	you,” he began, with his nasty,
	supercilious grin, which of late had
	been getting on my nerves severely.</p>

	<p>“Thanks,” I replied, curtly, paying no
	attention to his outstretched hand. “I
	want you to put a notice of the marriage
	in to-morrow morning’s <cite>Herald</cite>.”</p>

	<p>“Give me the facts—clergyman’s
	name—place, and so on,” said he.</p>

	<p>“Unnecessary,” I answered. “Just
	our names and the date—that’s all.
	You’d better step lively. It’s late, and
	it’ll be too late if you delay.”</p>

	<p>With an irritating show of deliberation
	he lit a fresh cigarette before setting
	out. I heard her maid come. After
	about an hour I went into the hall—no
	light showed through the transoms
	of her suit. I returned to my own
	part of the flat and went to bed in the
	spare room to which Sanders had hastily
	moved my personal belongings.
	And almost as soon as my head touched
	the pillow I was asleep. That day which
	began in disaster—in what a blaze of
	triumph it had ended! Anita—she was
	my wife, and under my roof! But
	stronger than the sense of victory won
	was a new emotion—a sense of a duty
	done, of a responsibility begun.</p>

	<h3><abbr title="fourteen">XIV</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Joe got to the office rather later than
	usual the next morning. They told him
	I was already there, but he wouldn’t believe
	it until he had come into my private
	den and with his own eyes had
	seen me. “Well, I’m jiggered!” said
	he. “It seems to have made less impression
	on you than it did on us. My
	missus and the little un wouldn’t let me
	go to bed till after two. They sat on
	and on, questioning me and discussing.”</p>

	<p>I laughed—partly because I knew
	that Joe, like most men, was as full of
	gossip and as eager for it as a convalescent
	old maid, and that, whoever
	might have been the first at his house
	to make the break for bed, he was the
	last to leave off talking. But the chief
	reason for my laugh was that, just before
	he came in on me, I was almost
	pinching myself to see whether I was
	dreaming it all, and he had made me
	feel how vividly true it was.</p>

	<p>“Why don’t you ease down, Blacklock?”
	he went on. “Everything’s
	smooth. The business—at least, my
	end of it, and I suppose your end, too—was
	never in better shape, never
	growing so fast. You could go off for
	a week or two, just as well as not.”</p>

	<p>And he honestly thought it, so little
	did I let him know about the larger
	enterprises of Blacklock &amp; Co. I could
	have spoken a dozen words, and he
	would have been floundering like a
	caught fish in a basket. There are men—a
	very few—who work more swiftly
	and more surely when they know
	they’re on the brink of ruin; but not
	Joe. One glimpse of our real National
	Coal account, and all my power over
	him couldn’t have kept him from showing
	the whole Street that Blacklock &amp;
	Co. was shaky. And whenever the
	Street begins to think a man is shaky,
	he must be strong indeed to escape the
	fate of the wolf that stumbles as it runs
	with the pack.</p>

	<p>“No holiday at present, Joe,” was my
	reply to his suggestion. “Perhaps the
	second week in July; but our marriage
	was so sudden that we haven’t had the
	time to get ready for a trip.”</p>

	<p>“Yes—it <em>was</em> sudden, wasn’t it?”
	said Joe, curiosity twitching his nose
	like a dog’s at scent of a rat. “How
	did it happen?”</p>

	<p>“Oh, I’ll tell you some time,” replied
	I. “I must go to work now.”</p>

	<p>And work a-plenty there was. Before
	me rose a huge sheaf of clamorous
	telegrams from our out-of-town customers
	and our agents; and soon my
	anteroom was crowded with my local
	following, sore and shorn. I suppose
	a score or more of the habitual heavy
	plungers on my tips were ruined and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>hundreds of others were thousands and
	tens of thousands out of pocket. “Do
	you want me to talk to these people?”
	inquired Joe, with the kindly intention
	of giving me a chance to shift the unpleasant
	duty to him.</p>

	<p>“Certainly not,” said I. “When the
	place is jammed, let me know. I’ll jack
	’em up.”</p>

	<p>It made Joe uneasy for me even to
	talk of using my “language”—he would
	have crawled from the Battery to Harlem
	to keep me from using it on him.
	So he silently left me alone. My system
	of dealing face to face with the
	speculating and investing public had
	many great advantages over that of all
	the other big operators—the system of
	decoying the public from behind cleverly
	contrived screens and slaughtering
	it without showing so much as the tip
	of a gun or nose that could be identified.
	But to my method there was a
	disadvantage that made men, who happen
	to have more hypocrisy and less
	nerve than I, shrink from it—when one
	of my tips miscarried, down upon me
	would swoop the bad losers in a body to
	give me a turbulent and interesting
	quarter of an hour.</p>

	<p>Toward ten o’clock, my boy came in
	and said: “Mr. Ball thinks it’s about
	time for you to see some of these people.”</p>

	<p>I went into the main room, where the
	tickers and blackboards were. As I
	approached through my outer office I
	could hear the noise the crowd was
	making—as they cursed me. If you
	want to rile the very inmost soul of the
	average human being, don’t take his
	reputation or his wife; just cause him
	to lose money. There were among my
	customers many with the true, even-tenored
	sporting instinct. These were
	bearing their losses with philosophy—none
	of them was there. Of the perhaps
	three hundred who had come to
	ease their anguish by tongue-lashing
	me, every one was mad through and
	through—those who had lost a few
	hundred dollars as infuriated as those
	whom my misleading tip had cost thousands
	and tens of thousands; those
	whom I had helped to win all they had
	in the world more savage than those
	new to my following.</p>

	<p>I took my stand in the doorway, a
	step up from the floor of the main
	room. I looked all round until I had
	met each pair of angry eyes. They say
	I can give my face an expression that
	is anything but agreeable; such talent as
	I have in that direction I exerted then.
	The instant I appeared a silence fell;
	but I waited until the last pair, of claws
	drew in. Then I said, in the quiet tone
	the army officer uses when he tells the
	mob that the machine guns will open
	up in two minutes by the watch: “Gentlemen,
	in the effort to counteract my
	warning to the public, the Textile
	crowd rocketed the stock yesterday.
	Those who heeded my warning and
	sold got excellent prices. Those who
	did not should sell to-day. Not even
	the powerful interests behind Textile
	can long maintain yesterday’s prices.”</p>

	<p>A wave of restlessness passed over
	the crowd. Many shifted their eyes
	from me and began to murmur.</p>

	<p>I raised my voice slightly as I went
	on: “The speculators, the gamblers, are
	the only people who were hurt. Those
	who sold what they didn’t have are paying
	for their folly. I have no sympathy
	for them. Blacklock &amp; Co.
	wishes none such in its following, and
	seizes every opportunity to weed them
	out. We are in business only for the
	bona fide investing public, and we are
	stronger with that public to-day than
	we have ever been.”</p>

	<p>Again I looked from coward to coward
	of that mob, changed from three
	hundred strong to three hundred weak.
	Then I bowed and withdrew, leaving
	them to mutter and disperse. I felt well
	content with the trend of events—I
	who wished to impress the public and
	the financiers that I had broken with
	speculation and speculators, could I
	have had a better than this unexpected
	opportunity sharply to define my new
	course? And as Textiles, unsupported,
	fell toward the close of the day, my
	content rose toward my normal high
	spirits. There was no whisper in the
	Street that I was in trouble; on the
	contrary, the idea was gaining ground
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>that I had really long ceased to be a
	stock gambler and deserved a much
	better reputation than I had. Reputation
	is a matter of diplomacy rather
	than of desert. In all my career I was
	never less entitled to a good reputation
	than in those June days; yet the disastrous
	gambling follies, yes, and worse,
	I then committed, formed the secure
	foundation of my reputation for conservatism
	and square dealing. From
	that time dates the decline of the habit
	the newspapers had of speaking of me
	as “Black Matt” or “Matt” Blacklock.
	In them, and therefore in the public
	mind, I began to figure as “Mr. Blacklock”
	and “the well-known authority on
	finance.”</p>

	<p>No doubt, my marriage had something
	to do with this. Probably one
	couldn’t borrow much money directly
	in New York on the strength of a fashionable
	marriage; but, so all-pervading
	is the snobbishness there, one can get,
	by making a fashionable marriage, any
	quantity of that deferential respect
	from rich people which is, in some circumstances,
	easily convertible into cash
	and credit.</p>

	<p>I waited with a good deal of anxiety,
	as you may imagine, for the early editions
	of the afternoon papers. The first
	article my eye chanced upon was a mere
	wordy elaboration of the brief and
	vague announcement Monson had put
	in the <cite>Herald</cite>. Later came an interview
	with old Ellersly. “Not at all
	mysterious,” he had said to the reporters.
	“Mr. Blacklock found he
	would have to go abroad on business
	soon—he didn’t know just when. On
	the spur of the moment they decided to
	marry.” A good enough story, and I
	confirmed it when I admitted the reporters.
	I read their estimates of my
	fortune and of Anita’s with rather bitter
	amusement—she whose father was
	living from hand to mouth; I who could
	not have emerged from a forced settlement
	with enough to enable me to keep
	a trap. Still, when one is rich, the
	reputation of being rich is heavily expensive;
	but when one is poor the reputation
	of being rich can be made a
	wealth-giving asset.</p>

	<p>Even as I was reading these fables of
	my millions, there lay on the desk before
	me a statement of the exact posture
	of my affairs—a memorandum
	made by myself for my own eyes, and
	to be burned as soon as I mastered it.
	On the face of the figures the balance
	against me was appalling. My chief asset,
	indeed my only asset that measured
	up toward my debts, was my Coal
	stocks, those bought and those contracted
	for; and, while their par value
	far exceeded my liabilities, they had to
	appear in my memorandum at their actual
	market value on that day. I looked
	at the calendar—seventeen days until
	the reorganization scheme would be announced,
	only seventeen days!</p>

	<p>Less than three business weeks, and
	I should be out of the storm and sailing
	safer and smoother seas than I had ever
	known. “To indulge <em>hopes</em> is bad,”
	thought I, “but not to indulge <em>a</em> hope,
	when one has only it between him and
	the pit.” And I proceeded to plan on
	the not unwarranted assumption that
	my coal hope was a present reality. Indeed,
	what alternative had I? To put it
	among the future’s uncertainties was to
	put myself among the utterly ruined.
	Using as collateral the Coal stocks I
	had bought outright, I borrowed more
	money, and with it went still deeper into
	the Coal venture.</p>

	<p>The morality of these and many of
	my other doings in those days will no
	doubt be severely condemned. By no
	one more severely than by myself—now
	that the necessities which then compelled
	me have passed. There is no
	subject on which men talk, and think,
	more humbug than on that subject of
	morality. As a matter of fact, except
	in those personal relations which are
	governed by the affections, what is
	morality but the mandate of policy, and
	what is policy but the mandate of necessity?
	My criticism of Roebuck and
	the other “high financiers” is not upon
	their morality, but upon their policy,
	which is shortsighted and stupid and
	base. The moral difference between
	me and them is that, while I merely
	assert and maintain my right to live,
	they deny the right of any but themselves
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a>to live. I say I criticise them;
	but that does not mean that I sympathize
	with the public at large in its complainings
	against them. The public, its
	stupidity and cupidity, creates the conditions
	that breed and foster these men.
	A rotten cheese reviling the maggots it
	has bred!</p>

	<p>In those very hours when I was obeying
	the great imperative law of self-preservation,
	was clutching at every log
	that floated by me regardless of whether
	it was my property or not so long as it
	would help me keep my head above
	water—what was going on all around
	me? In every office of the downtown
	district—merchant, banker, broker,
	lawyer, man of commerce or finance—was
	not every busy brain plotting not
	self-preservation but pillage and sack—plotting
	to increase the cost of living
	for the masses of men by slipping a little
	tax here and a little tax there onto
	the cost of everything by which men
	live? All along the line between the
	farm or mine or shop and the market,
	at every one of the tollgates for the
	collection of <em>just</em> charges, these big
	financiers, backed up by the big lawyers
	and the rascally public officials, had an
	agent in charge to collect on each passing
	article a little more than was honestly
	due. A thousand subtle ways of
	levying, all combining to pour in upon
	the few the torrents of unjust wealth.
	I always laugh when I read of laboring
	men striking for higher wages. Poor,
	ignorant fools—they almost deserve
	their fate. They had better be concerning
	themselves with a huge, universal
	strike at the polls for lower prices.
	What will it avail them to get higher
	wages, so long as their masters control
	and can and will recoup on, the prices
	of all the things for which those wages
	must be spent?</p>

	<p>However, as I was saying, I lived in
	Wall Street, in its atmosphere of the
	practical morality of “finance.” On
	every side swindling operations, great
	and small; operations regarded as right
	through long-established custom, dishonest
	or doubtful; operations on the
	way to becoming established by custom
	as “respectable.” No man’s title to
	anything conceded unless he had the
	brains to defend it. There was a time
	when it would have been regarded as
	wildly preposterous and viciously immoral
	to deny property rights in human
	beings. There may come a time—who
	knows?—when “high finance’s” denial
	of a moral right to property of any kind
	may cease to be regarded as wicked.
	However, I attempt no excuses for myself;
	I need them no more than a judge
	in the Dark Ages needed to apologize
	for ordering a witch to the stake. I
	could no more have done differently
	than a fish could breathe on land or a
	man under water. I did as all the others
	did—and I had the justification of
	necessity. Right of might being the
	code, when men set upon me with pistols,
	I meet them with pistols, not with
	the discarded and antiquated weapons
	of sermon and prayer and the law.</p>

	<p>And I thought extremely well of myself
	and of my pistols that June afternoon,
	as I was hurrying uptown the moment
	the day’s settlement on ‘Change
	was finished. I had sent out my daily
	letter to investors, and its tone of confidence
	was genuine—I knew that hundreds
	of customers of a better class
	would soon be flocking in to take the
	places of those I had been compelled to
	teach a lesson in the vicissitudes of
	gambling. With a light heart and the
	physical feeling of a football player
	in training, I sped toward home.
	Home! For the first time since I was
	a squat little slip of a shaver the word
	had a personal meaning for me. Perhaps,
	if the only other home of mine
	had been less uninviting, I should not
	have looked forward with such high
	beating of the heart to that cold home
	Anita was making for me. No, I withdraw
	that. It is fellows like me, to
	whom kindly looks and unbought attentions
	are as unfamiliar as flowers to
	the Arctic—it is men like me that appreciate
	and treasure and warm up under
	the faintest show or shadowy suggestion
	of the sunshine of sentiment.
	I’d be a little ashamed to say how much
	money I handed out to servants and
	beggars and street gamins that day. I
	had a home to go to!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"> </a>As my electric drew up at the Willoughby,
	a carriage backed to make
	room for it. I recognized the horses
	and the driver and the crests. “How
	long has Mrs. Ellersly been with my
	wife?” I asked the elevator boy, as he
	was taking me up.</p>

	<p>“About half an hour, sir,” he answered.
	“But Mr. Ellersly—I took up
	his card before lunch, and he’s still
	there.”</p>

	<p>Instead of using my key, I rang the
	bell, and when Sanders opened, I said:
	“Is Mrs. Blacklock in?” in a voice loud
	enough to penetrate to the drawing
	room.</p>

	<p>As I had hoped, Anita appeared. Her
	dress told me that her trunks had come—she
	had sent for her trunks! “Mother
	and father are here,” said she, without
	looking at me.</p>

	<p>I followed her into the drawing room
	and, for the benefit of the servants, Mr.
	and Mrs. Ellersly and I greeted each
	other courteously, though Mrs. Ellersly’s
	eyes and mine met in a glance like
	the flash of steel on steel. “We were
	just going,” said she, and then I felt
	that I had arrived in the midst of a
	tempest of uncommon fury.</p>

	<p>“You must stop and make me a visit,”
	protested I, with elaborate politeness.
	To myself I was assuming that they had
	come to “make up and be friends”—and
	resume their places at the trough.</p>

	<p>“I wish we could,” she answered, in
	her best manner. And she was moving
	toward the door, the old man in her
	wake. Neither of them offered to shake
	hands with me; neither made pretense
	of saying good-by to Anita, standing
	by the window like a pillar of ice. I
	had closed the drawing-room door behind
	me, as I entered. I was about to
	open it for them when I was restrained
	by what I saw working in the old woman’s
	face. She had set her will on escaping
	from my loathed presence without a
	“scene”; but her rage at having been
	outgeneraled was too fractious for her
	will.</p>

	<p>“You scoundrel!” she hissed, her
	whole body shaking and her carefully
	cultivated appearance of the gracious
	evening of youth swallowed up in a
	black cyclone of hate. “You gutter
	plant! God will punish you for the
	shame you have brought upon us.”</p>

	<p>I opened the door and bowed, without
	a word, without even the desire to
	return insult for insult—had not Anita
	again and finally rejected them and
	chosen me? As they passed into the
	private hall I rang for Sanders to come
	and let them out. When I turned back
	into the drawing room, Anita was
	seated, was reading a book. I waited
	until I saw she was not going to speak.
	Then I said: “What time will you have
	dinner?” But my face must have been
	expressing some of the joy and gratitude
	that filled me. “She has chosen
	me!” I was saying to myself over and
	over.</p>

	<p>“Whenever you usually have it,” she
	replied, without looking up.</p>

	<p>“At seven o’clock, then. You had
	better tell Sanders.” And I rang for
	him and went into my little smoking
	room. She had resisted her parents’
	final appeal to her to return to them.
	She had cast in her lot with me. “The
	rest can be left to time,” said I to myself.
	And, reviewing all that had happened,
	I let a wild hope thrust tenacious
	roots deep into me—the hope that
	she did not quite understand her own
	mind as to me. How often ignorance is
	a blessing; how often knowledge would
	make the step falter and the heart quail.
	Who would have the courage, not to
	speak of the desire, to live his life, if he
	knew his own future?</p>

	<h3><abbr title="fifteen">XV</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>During dinner I bore the whole burden
	of conversation—though burden I
	did not find it. Like most of the most
	reticent men, I am extremely talkative.
	Silence sets people to wondering and
	prying; he hides his secrets best who
	hides them at the bottom of a river of
	words. If my spirits are high, I often
	talk aloud to myself when there is no
	one convenient. And how could my
	spirits be anything but high, with her
	sitting there opposite me, mine, mine
	for better or for worse, through good
	and evil report—my wife!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>She was only formally responsive, reluctant
	and brief in answers, volunteering
	nothing. The servants waiting on
	us no doubt laid her manner to shyness;
	I understood it, or thought I did—but
	I was not troubled. It is as natural
	for me to hope as to breathe; and with
	my knowledge of character, how could
	I take seriously the moods and impulses
	of one whom I regarded as a childlike
	girl, trained in false pride and false
	ideals? “She has chosen to stay with
	me,” said I to myself. “Actions count,
	not words or manner. A few days or
	weeks, and she will be herself, and
	mine.” And I went gayly on with my
	efforts to interest her, to make her smile
	and forget the rôle she had commanded
	herself to play. Nor was I wholly unsuccessful.
	Again and again I thought
	I saw a gleam of interest in her eyes
	or the beginnings of a smile about that
	sweet mouth of hers. I was careful not
	to overdo my part. As soon as we finished
	dessert I said: “You loathe cigar
	smoke, so I’ll hide myself in my den.
	Sanders will bring you the cigarettes.”
	I had myself telephoned for a supply of
	her kind early in the day.</p>

	<p>She made a polite protest for the
	benefit of the servants; but I was firm,
	and she was free to think things over
	alone in the drawing room—“your sitting
	room,” I called it now. I had not
	finished a small cigar when there came
	a timid knock at my door. I threw
	away the cigar and opened. “I thought
	it was you,” said I. “I’m familiar with
	the knocks of all the others. And this
	was new—like a summer wind tapping
	with a flower for admission at a closed
	window.” And I laughed with a little
	raillery, and she smiled, colored, tried to
	seem cold and hostile again.</p>

	<p>“Shall I go with you to your sitting
	room?” I went on. “Perhaps the cigar
	smoke here——”</p>

	<p>“No, no,” she interrupted; “I don’t
	really mind cigars—and the windows
	are wide open. Besides, I came for
	only a moment—just to say——”</p>

	<p>As she cast about for words to carry
	her on, I drew up a chair for her. She
	looked at it uncertainly, seated herself.
	“When mamma was here—this afternoon,”
	she went on, “she was urging me
	to—to do what she wished. And after
	she had used several arguments, without
	changing me—she said something
	I—I’ve been thinking it over, and it
	seemed I ought in fairness to tell you.”</p>

	<p>I waited.</p>

	<p>“She said: ‘In a few days more he’—that
	meant you—‘he will be ruined. He
	imagines the worst is over for him,
	when in fact they’ve only begun.’”</p>

	<p>“They!” I repeated. “Who are
	‘they’? The Langdons?”</p>

	<p>“I think so,” she replied, with an
	effort. “She did not say—I’ve told you
	her exact words—as far as I can.”</p>

	<p>“Well,” said I, “and why didn’t you
	go?”</p>

	<p>She pressed her lips firmly together.
	Finally, with a straight look into my
	eyes, she replied: “I shall not discuss
	that. You probably misunderstand, but
	that is your own affair.”</p>

	<p>“You believed what she said about
	me, of course,” said I.</p>

	<p>“I neither believed nor disbelieved,”
	she answered, indifferently, as she rose
	to go. “It does not interest me.”</p>

	<p>“Come here,” said I. And I waited
	until she reluctantly joined me at the
	window. I pointed to the steeple of
	the church across the way. “You could
	as easily throw down that steeple by
	pushing against it with your bare
	hands,” I said to her, “as ‘they,’ whoever
	they are, could put me down. They
	might take away my money. But if
	they did, they would only be giving me
	a lesson that would teach me how more
	easily to get it back again. I am not a
	bundle of stock certificates or a bag of
	money. I am—here,” and I tapped my
	forehead.</p>

	<p>She forced a faint, scornful smile.
	She did not wish me to see her belief of
	what I said.</p>

	<p>“You think that is vanity,” I went on.
	“But you will learn, sooner or later, the
	difference between boasting and simple
	statement of fact. You will learn that
	I do not boast. What I said is no more
	a boast than for a man with legs to say,
	‘I can walk.’ Because you have known
	only legless men, you exaggerate the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>difficulty of walking. It’s as easy for
	me to make money as it is for some people
	to spend it.”</p>

	<p>It is hardly necessary for me to say
	I was not insinuating anything against
	her people. But she was just then
	supersensitive on the subject, though I
	did not suspect it. She flushed hotly.
	“You will not have any cause to sneer
	at my people on that account hereafter,”
	she said. “I settled <em>that</em> to-day.”</p>

	<p>“I was not sneering at them,” I protested.
	“I wasn’t even thinking of
	them. And—you must know that it’s a
	favor to me for anybody to ask me to
	do anything that will please you.”</p>

	<p>She made a gesture of impatience.
	“I see I’d better tell you why—part of
	the reason why—I did not go with them
	to-day. I insisted that they give back
	all they have taken from you. And
	when they refused, I refused to go.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t care why you refused,” said
	I. “I am content with the fact that you
	are here.”</p>

	<p>“But you misunderstand it,” she said,
	coldly.</p>

	<p>“I don’t understand it, I don’t misunderstand
	it,” was my reply. “I accept
	it.”</p>

	<p>She looked depressed, discouraged.
	She turned away from the window,
	drifted out of the room. While the
	surface of my mind was taken up with
	her, I must have been thinking, underneath,
	of the warning she had brought;
	for, perhaps half or three-quarters of
	an hour after she left, I was suddenly
	whirled out of my reverie at the window
	by a thought like a pistol thrust
	into my face. “What if ‘they’ should
	include Roebuck!” And just as a man
	begins to defend himself from a sudden
	danger before he clearly sees what the
	danger is, so I began to act before I
	even questioned whether my suspicion
	was plausible or absurd. I went into
	the hall, rang the bell, slipped a lightweight
	coat over my evening dress
	and put on a hat. When Sanders appeared,
	I said: “I’m going out for a few
	minutes—perhaps an hour—if anyone
	should ask.” A moment later I was in
	a hansom and on the way to Roebuck’s.</p>

		<h2>AMERICANS IN LONDON</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Lady Willshire</p>
	</div>
	<p class="synopsis">The author of the following essay on &#8220;Americans in London&#8221; is one of the most distinguished of the
	leaders of English Society. She is the daughter of Sir Sanford Freeling, who was for a time military
	secretary at <ins id="corr4" class="corr" title="Gibralter">Gibraltar</ins>. Her husband, Sir Arthur Willshire, was an officer in the Guards. Lady Willshire,
	in addition to her social activities, is, without ostentation, a woman whose charities occupy a large part of
	her time. In appearance she is over middle height, rather fragile, with great charm of manner. She is an
	accomplished musician and linguist. Her favorite recreations are riding, driving and bicycling, and she is
	looked upon as the best dancer in London Society.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap7.png" width="120" height="115" alt="I" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">I can</span> well remember the
	time when I could easily
	reckon up the whole
	list of my American
	acquaintances resident
	in London on the fingers
	of one hand, and
	most of those were the wives of English
	husbands.</p>

	<p>That was certainly not more than ten
	years ago, and then the majority of
	Americans that one chanced to meet in
	England were travelers, who knew very
	little of, and cared less apparently to see
	or take part in, the doings of our London
	society.</p>

	<p>In ten years, however, amazing
	changes can and do take place, especially
	where the natives of the States are
	concerned, and nowadays I find that not
	only does it require a great many leaves
	in my capacious address book to hold the
	names of the Americans—and the women
	most particularly—who live and
	move and have a large part of their social
	being in London, but that a very
	impressive majority of these attractive
	and prominent ladies are not the life
	partners of voting, title-holding British
	subjects at all.</p>

	<p>The good work accomplished both
	ways by the international marriage goes
	merrily on. At the present moment we
	can claim not less than twenty-five peeresses
	of transatlantic birth, while we
	don’t pretend to keep anything like an
	exact record of the ever-increasing acquisitions,
	from American sources, to
	our gentry class; but, for all that, the
	present big average of American women
	who come across the ocean to conduct
	a successful siege of London no
	longer regard the English husband as a
	sort of necessary preliminary and essential
	ally to the business of getting on in
	our smart metropolitan society.</p>

	<p>The fair and welcome invader from
	the land of the free and the home of
	the brave can, and does, “arrive” astonishingly
	well without masculine assistance
	and encouragement.</p>

	<p>She may appear as maid, wife or widow;
	sometimes as divorcee; but, personally,
	she conducts her own campaign.
	Furthermore, she comes fully equipped
	to carry everything before her—she has
	wit, wealth and good looks at her command,
	and she works along approved
	and sensible lines of action.</p>

	<p>If she has a thoroughgoing conquest
	<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>of London planned out, she does not
	put up at a fashionable hotel and spread
	her fine plumage and wait for notice.</p>

	<p>She usually begins by taking a house;
	she furnishes it with original but discreet
	good taste; she wears startlingly
	pretty gowns—quite the best, as a rule,
	that Paris can supply; she gives the
	most taking sorts of entertainments, and
	the ordinary result is that in one season
	she is not only launched and talked
	about, but securely placed and greatly
	admired.</p>

	<p>And if you want to know why she
	does this thing, the answer you can get,
	as I did, from her own mouth; she
	simply “likes London and London
	society.”</p>

	<p>As an amiable, broad-minded woman,
	she does not love her own country so
	much that she cannot find a place in her
	heart for London, too, and that which
	chiefly appeals to her in our elderly,
	sprawling, sooty, amusing and splendid
	old capital is the fact that she finds it
	interesting.</p>

	<p>There you have one explanation, at
	least, of the apparent phenomenon of
	the ever-growing circle of American
	women in the very heart of our biggest
	city. But it becomes a Londoner to
	confess that another good reason why
	she is so familiar and conspicuous a
	figure among us is because we reciprocate
	her liking with the strongest possible
	warmth of admiration.</p>

	<p>Not only do we regard our American
	colony with genuine enthusiasm, and
	take pride and pleasure in the fact that
	it is the largest of its kind in any European
	capital, but social London pleasantly
	feels its influence.</p>

	<p>Now, influence is one of those qualities
	that the American woman carries
	about with her just as naturally as she
	carries her pretty airs of independence,
	or her capacity for easy and amusing
	speech, and it is a sad mistake for anyone
	to take it for granted that on her
	wealth or her pulchritude alone all her
	claim to success and popularity in England
	rests.</p>

	<p>In no way that I know of has her
	influence been more sensibly and beneficially
	felt among us than in the introduction
	of a quick, vivacious tone to
	conversation.</p>

	<p>Her gift for light, easy, semi-humorous
	talk, her gay, self-confident way of
	telling a good story, constitute her a
	leading and most lasting attraction in
	English estimation. From her the English
	woman has learned, first, that which
	it seems every transatlantic sister is
	aware by intuition, that one supreme
	duty of the sex, as it is represented in
	society, is to know how to talk a little
	to everybody, to talk always in sprightly
	fashion, and never to adopt the English
	woman’s depressing method of answering
	all conversational efforts and
	overtures with chilling monosyllables.</p>

	<p>It is no exaggeration to say that since
	the tremendous enlargement of the
	American colony, the whole pace of
	London drawing-room talk has enormously
	improved. We British are not
	by nature a sprightly and speechful
	race, with the gift of gay gab, but under
	the American woman’s cheerful influence
	we are enjoying a sort of reformation.</p>

	<p>We send our daughters even to a
	fashionable school in fashionable Kensington,
	which is kept by a long-headed
	American woman, who will very nearly
	guarantee to bid a door post discourse
	freely and be obeyed. And the women
	to whom first honors are due for having
	inspired London with a wholesome respect
	for what I may justly call the
	very superior American parts of speech,
	are Mrs. George Cornwallis-West—perhaps
	better known on both sides of the
	ocean as Lady Randolph Churchill—and
	Consuelo, the Dowager Duchess of
	Manchester.</p>

	<p>It would be a superfluous and ungrateful
	task to try to recall the number
	of years that have flown since these
	two women, unusually attractive as they
	are, even for Americans, came over to
	literally take London by storm.</p>

	<p>Suffice it to say that, as Shakespeare
	wrote of Cleopatra, “age cannot wither
	nor custom stale her infinite variety;”
	and in spite of the amazing influx of
	their young and lovely and accomplished
	countrywomen into London
	since their day of arrival, these two ladies
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>still stand, as they have stood for
	years, at the very top of the entire
	American set abroad.</p>

	<p>Both of them, by marriage or through
	years of long association, have become
	thoroughly identified with English society,
	but, unlike Lady Vernon-Harcourt,
	widow of the great leader of the
	Liberal party, and daughter of the famous
	historian Motley, they have never
	lost their strong American individuality.</p>

	<p>Lady Vernon-Harcourt, to sight and
	hearing, seems almost a typical and
	thoroughgoing English woman, but
	Mrs. George Cornwallis-West and the
	Duchess Consuelo are, to all intents and
	purposes, as distinctly American as the
	day on which they were presented as
	brides and beauties at one of Queen
	Victoria’s drawing-rooms.</p>

	<p>Then, as well as now, they were both
	fair to look upon, but they were also
	something more—they were the cleverest
	of talkers, and the beautiful Consuelo,
	in her soft, Southern voice, possessed
	a faculty for quaint and witty
	turns of phrase that made her an instant
	favorite.</p>

	<p>At the time of her début, London had
	yet to meet the American woman who
	could not only chatter along cheerfully
	and intelligently, but who could artfully
	and unembarrassedly tell an amusing
	story before the big and critical audience
	that the average dinner table
	supplies. Our fair Creole and the fair
	New Yorker were, however, more than
	equal to all and any such emergencies
	and occasions.</p>

	<p>It was with their capable tongues,
	quite as much as with their charming
	faces, that they scored their social triumphs
	in England, and it was mainly
	through their beguiling conversational
	powers that they both caught the attention
	of the present king and queen—at
	that time Prince and Princess of Wales—and
	aroused royalty’s prompt and
	lasting admiration.</p>

	<p>Until that time no American could
	boast the fact that she was the friend
	of the queen, prince or princess, but the
	young duchess and Lady Randolph
	Churchill changed all that. They were
	the first of their nation to be asked to
	the Sandringham house parties, to be
	included in the lists of guests invited
	to meet royal folk at dinners, etc., and
	to inspire in the present king and queen
	the thoroughgoing liking they now
	cherish for American things in general
	and the American woman in particular.</p>

	<p>A good deal of brown Thames water
	has flowed under London Bridge, it is
	true, since these exponents of two entirely
	different types of American womanhood
	came over to astonish even our
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</em> society, but no two of their sex
	and nation have succeeded in making a
	more deep and lasting impression upon
	London than these, or have done more
	to insure the social success of their
	countrywomen who followed in their
	footsteps.</p>

	<p>Consuelo, the duchess, is a grandmother
	to-day, but she is almost as
	prominent a figure in the gay world as
	she ever was; unlike Mrs. George Cornwallis-West,
	she never went in, so to
	speak, for political prestige. She has
	cared for social gayety pure and simple,
	preserved much of her beauty, maintained
	her reputation as the most delightful
	house-party guest in England,
	and is noted nowadays as being, as well,
	the most skillful, tactful and serenely
	polite bridge-whist partner in the
	United Kingdom.</p>

	<p>When, a few months ago, a house-party
	for royalty was given at Chatsworth
	by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire,
	it was at the urgent request of
	both the king and queen that the Dowager
	Duchess of Manchester came over
	from Paris to spend a few days under
	the same roof with their majesties,
	whose affection for this low-voiced,
	sweet-tempered, witty American woman
	has never wavered. Every now and
	then one hears anew in London drawing
	rooms of some amusing saying of
	hers, for she is as gracious and graceful
	a conversationalist as of yore, and
	with three young and blooming American
	duchesses to rival her, still stands
	well apart from and ahead of them all,
	at least so far as the homage of our
	smart and titled society can be accepted
	as proof of a woman’s position.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>Of all the three young duchesses, I
	think her youthful Grace of Marlborough
	is far and away the most distinctly
	popular and influential. She has conquered
	even the most indifferent and the
	most prejudiced, by an exquisitely
	charming sweetness of manner that is
	quite irresistible.</p>

	<p>She does not possess what a Frenchman
	would call the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vif</em> style of her average
	countrywomen, and she is not a
	very vigorous talker, but she is wonderfully
	sympathetic and attractive of
	manner; her porcelain fine, aristocratic
	prettiness makes her a distinguished figure
	wherever she goes, and from the
	first she presided at the head of her vast
	establishment, and took her rightful position
	in England with a natural dignity
	and a complete grasp of the situation
	that literally took the breath away
	from the rather skeptical British onlooker.</p>

	<p>There is a story told, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</em>, of the
	discomfiture of a high-nosed and rather
	too helpful aristocratic matron and relative,
	who, on the arrival of her shy
	looking, slim young Grace, undertook
	to set her right and well beforehand
	on points of etiquette, ducal duty and
	responsibilities, etc.</p>

	<p>Nobody knows to this day just what
	passed between the fair girl and the
	stately matron, but the duchess was not
	very much bothered with unnecessary
	advice after one short interview with
	her rather officious social fairy-godmother.
	And if the duchess was not
	ready to take advice, it was simply because
	she did not need it. When she
	gave her first great house party at Blenheim,
	it rather outrivaled in splendor
	anything of the sort done in England
	in a long time, and her chief guests
	were royalties; nevertheless, there was
	not a hitch or a mistake in all the elaborate
	proceedings; and a critical peer,
	who enjoyed the magnificent hospitality
	of the Marlboroughs, was heard to
	remark afterward that to be born an
	American millionairess is to apparently
	know by instinct all that has to be
	taught from childhood to a native English
	duchess.</p>

	<p>That Her Grace of Marlborough has
	a natural taste for splendid surroundings
	is shown by her fondness for big
	Blenheim and the marvelous luxury she
	has introduced into every part of that
	vast mansion; and when her indulgent
	father offered to buy for her a house in
	London, she imposed but two guiding
	conditions on his choice for her of a
	home in town.</p>

	<p>“I want the biggest house on the most
	fashionable street,” she is said to have
	said. The result was that Mr. Vanderbilt
	purchased Sunderland House, in
	Curzon Street, and there the duchess is
	fittingly installed.</p>

	<p>There the most sumptuous decorating
	and furnishing has been done, and
	when she entertains, her dinners will
	be the most splendid and her balls the
	largest and most luxurious of the season,
	for whatever the duchess does is
	done in almost regal style.</p>

	<p>Eventually no London hostess can
	or will outshine her, and yet this first
	among the American duchesses is not
	very socially inclined. She prefers the
	country life and Blenheim to the best
	that London can give her, and this taste
	is to a great measure shared by many
	of our American peeresses and guests.</p>

	<p>The Countess of Orford, Lady Monson,
	the Countess of Donoughmore,
	Mrs. Spender Clay, Lady Charles Ross
	and Mrs. Langhorne Shaw, for example,
	find English country life pre-eminently
	to their taste, and all but avoid
	the town, save in the very height of the
	season.</p>

	<p>Lady Orford—who was Miss Corbin—lives
	at Waborne Hall, her husband’s
	magnificent Georgian place in Norfolk.
	There she gives shooting parties, from
	there she goes with her husband and
	pretty young daughter to fish in Scotland
	and Norway, and the chief interest
	that brings her up to London is her
	taste for music and the opera, which,
	she declares, is the only pleasure that
	one cannot gratify out of town.</p>

	<p>Next after music, sport—fishing most
	especially—engages her particular interest.
	Though she rarely goes out
	with the guns, her husband declares she
	is a capital shot, and that she could and
	would ride to hounds with the most daring
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"> </a>of our fox-hunting peeresses, if
	Norfolk was a hunting shire.</p>

	<p>Prominent, however, among the
	hunting set is the handsome Countess
	of Donoughmore, whose father, the
	American millionaire Grace, owns Battle
	Abbey, and has made England his
	home for many years. His slender,
	pretty daughter, who was Miss Eleana
	Grace before she married an Irish earl,
	rode to hounds from her days of floating
	locks and short skirts.</p>

	<p>Now, as a fair and fashionable peeress,
	she hunts Ireland and England
	both with all the zest and skill of a native-born
	Irish woman. Her keenest
	American competitor, in the art of hard
	cross-country riding, is a young and
	beautiful Virginian, Mrs. Langhorne-Shaw,
	who comes over every year to
	hunt, and for no other purpose.</p>

	<p>In spite of all her youth and beauty
	and charm, this fair sister-in-law of the
	famous American artist, Charles Dana
	Gibson, scarcely makes an appearance
	in London at all. She arrives in England
	at the season when the scent is
	best and the hounds at their briskest,
	and, American-wise, she takes a house
	in the very heart of the hunting district.</p>

	<p>Sometimes she brings over her own
	string of horses from her native State,
	for she is a judge of sound and capable
	animals; and she has done more
	than any other one of her sex and race
	to prove that the American-built riding
	habit is a capital garment, and that
	when she is well mounted and in the
	field there are few in England who can
	surpass an American woman at hard
	and intelligent riding.</p>

	<p>Lady Monson, though less of a
	sportswoman than Lady Donoughmore
	or Mrs. Langhorne-Shaw, is, if anything,
	more devoted to country life in
	England than either, for a very great
	part of every year she spends, by preference,
	at her husband’s beautiful home,
	“Barton Hall,” and there she entertains
	not only extensively and luxuriously,
	but chiefly the diplomats, domestic and
	foreign.</p>

	<p>This capacity for gathering about her
	quite the most interesting among <ins id="corr5" class="corr" title="notaable">notable</ins>
	men has made her house parties
	rather famous in an enviable way, and
	has given Lady Monson a marked reputation
	as a hostess. Her husband is
	the nephew of Sir Edmund Monson,
	the well-known ambassador to France,
	and Lady Monson is herself a famous
	beauty. Before her first marriage, to a
	wealthy New Yorker, she was Miss Romaine
	Stone, and celebrated in London,
	Newport and New York for a
	uniquely delicate loveliness of face and
	form.</p>

	<p>Her beauty was, indeed, as widely
	talked about and ardently admired in
	London as was that of Lady Naylor
	Leyland some years ago, or as we now
	very enthusiastically discuss the charming
	features of Mrs. Sam Chauncey or
	Lady Ross, who are prominent members
	of the younger American colony.</p>

	<p>Both of the last-mentioned fair
	women hail from the State of Kentucky—Lady
	Ross was Miss Patricia Ellison,
	of Louisville, and Mrs. Chauncey belongs
	to the ever-growing class of
	American women who have created a
	deep impression on London society by
	making the very most of some particular
	talent or taste or feature.</p>

	<p>Society in these days, like the professions
	of war, law or medicine, is in
	the hands of the specialists; and I think
	that the American women who came
	over to carve out their own social way
	saw this opportunity at once and have
	developed it in a quite remarkable fashion.</p>

	<p>The arbiters of social place are not
	handing out any of the big prizes to the
	women who are just agreeable in a commonplace
	style. Do the striking thing
	in London, and do it well, is the rule
	for success at this time, and the energetic,
	quickly perceiving American
	woman loses not a week nor a day after
	her arrival in proving to us that she is
	a definite person indeed.</p>

	<p>London society is made up of as
	many as ten different sets, all independent
	and powerful, each one in its own
	way, and the skill of the woman from
	New York or Chicago is displayed by
	her promptness in deciding on just the
	set into which she prefers to enter.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Bradley Martin, Lady Deerhurst,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>Lady Bagot; Cora, Lady Strafford—now
	known by her new married
	title as Mrs. Kennard—Lady Newborough
	and a score of others one could
	mention, are to be included among the
	Americans who have devoted their talents
	entirely to the conquering of the
	smartest of smart sets. Most of these
	have married titles, it is true, but titles
	are not essential, after all, where natural
	social gifts are possessed; Mrs. Sam
	Chauncey, for instance, is a case in
	point.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Chauncey is an American widow
	and a beauty, with a most agreeable
	manner and lively intelligence; she
	presides in a bewitching bijou of a little
	house in Hertford Street, and drives
	one of the smartest miniature victorias
	that appear in the park. But London’s
	first and most striking impression concerning
	this delightful acquisition from
	the States was derived from her wonderful
	and lovely gowns—her French
	frocks are, for taste and becomingness,
	quite paralyzing to even a breath of
	criticism, and from the first moment of
	her début in London they excited only
	the most whole-souled enthusiasm in
	the hearts of all beholders of both sexes.</p>

	<p>To say that she is rather particularly
	famous as the best dressed woman in
	our great city is, perhaps, to make a
	pretty strong assertion, in the face of
	very serious competition offered by
	women notable for the perfection of
	their wardrobe, but this claim really
	stands on good grounds. Even among
	her compatriots, she seems always astonishingly
	well gowned, and really, if
	we are going to honestly give honor
	where honor is due, we must put natural
	pride and sentiment aside and agree
	that the presence of the American woman
	in London has had a marked and
	salutary influence on the whole dress
	problem as English women look at it.</p>

	<p>Not to mince matters, we may as well
	confess that <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Americaines</em> do gown
	themselves with superlative taste. Our
	peeresses and visitors from the States
	know what to wear and how to wear it;
	they show so much tact in their choice
	of colors, they put on their gay gowns
	and hats with such a completeness of
	touch, and display so much instinct for
	style in the choice and use of small etceteras,
	that it is idle to say we English
	have not been compelled to notice and
	admire.</p>

	<p>If imitation is truly the sincerest flattery,
	as some ancient wiseacre said
	years ago, then there is pretty clear evidence
	daily afforded to prove that we
	are complimenting our American sisters
	by slowly adopting their ideas of dress.</p>

	<p>More and more each season does
	Paris send us the sort of gown and
	hatpin, belt and handkerchief and hair
	ornament, that goes to New York, and
	more and more is the saying, “She
	dresses quite like an American woman,”
	accepted as a kindly comment,
	wherever it is offered.</p>

	<p>A general impression, also, is prevailing
	to the effect that one reason why
	our American cousins wear their fine
	frocks with such good results is because
	they hold their heads high and their
	backs flat and straight. There is even
	now, in London, a vastly popular <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corsetière</em>
	who does not hesitate to recommend
	herself as the only artiste in
	town who can persuade any form, stout
	or lean, to assume at once the exact outlines
	of the admired American figure.</p>

	<p>The Duchess of Roxburghe, Mrs.
	Kennard and the Countess of Suffolk
	are all very fair examples, in our eyes,
	of the high perfection of line to which
	the feminine form divine can and does
	attain in America; for all these women
	hold themselves with the most superlative
	grace, wear gowns that would make
	Solomon in all his glory feel envious,
	and help to maintain the now fixed belief
	in England that all Americans are
	tall, straight, slender and born with a
	capacity for wearing diamond tiaras
	with as much ease as straw hats.</p>

	<p>It would not be fair, though, to lay
	too much of the social success of King
	Edward’s fair new subjects and visitors
	wholly at their wardrobe doors, for the
	two most influential and prominent
	American women just now in London
	are neither of them titled, nor do they
	place too much stress on the gorgeousness
	of their frocks and frills.</p>

	<p>Both Mrs. Arthur Paget—who was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>Miss Minnie Stevens, of New York—and
	Mrs. Ronalds are listed everywhere
	among the most popular of our hostesses,
	and Mrs. Ronalds, especially, is a
	distinct power in the musical world.
	Scarcely a famous artist comes to town
	but sooner or later he hears, to his advantage,
	of this wealthy American.</p>

	<p>Her red and white music room—by
	far the most artistic and completely
	equipped private salon of its kind in
	London—has sheltered distinguished
	companies of the very fashionable and
	intellectual English music lovers; she
	has made her Sunday afternoons of
	something more than mere frivolous importance,
	and won for them, indeed, a
	decided and enviable celebrity, for Mrs.
	Ronalds is one of those American women
	who possess a genius for hospitality.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Paget, it is true, takes due rank
	in the same category, and both these
	women have all the truly American
	tastes for featuring their entertainments
	most delightfully. To continue
	in the commonplace round of quite
	conventional functions, as approved by
	society, is not to be borne by these energetic
	and novelty-loving ladies, and a
	dinner, a supper party or a dance at
	Mrs. Paget’s is sure to develop some
	unexpected and charming phase.</p>

	<p>It is to Mrs. Paget, for example, that
	we are indebted for the introduction of
	that purely American festivity, “The
	Ladies’ Luncheon.” “The Ladies’
	Luncheon” is now quite acclimatized
	here; we have accepted it as we have
	also accepted “The Ladies’ Dinner-party,”
	which was wholly unknown
	previous to the American invasion.
	Whether Mrs. Paget was instrumental
	or not in making for the last-mentioned
	form of entertainment a place among
	our conservative hostesses is not quite
	proven, but it is safe to say that this
	tall, vivacious, energetic lady, who
	skates as well as she dances, golfs and
	drives a motor car, carries almost more
	social power in her small right hand
	than any other untitled woman in London.</p>

	<p>She is heartily admired by our present
	king and queen, who find in her
	sparkling talk very much the same mental
	stimulus that one derives from the
	Duchess Consuelo’s gay epigrams, and,
	above everything else, the court and its
	circle of society reverence the charms
	of the woman whose brain bubbles over
	with ideas.</p>

	<p>If a dance, a dinner, a bazaar or a
	picnic is on foot, Mrs. Paget can map
	out and put through the enterprise with
	amazing skill and readiness, and she
	shows all the American’s shrewd business
	instinct for profitably pleasing a
	ticket-purchasing public when a charity
	fund must be swelled or a hospital assisted.</p>

	<p>With her vigor, high spirits and infinite
	variety of charm, she is enormously
	sought after and courted and
	fêted, but it is noticeable, and none the
	less admirable, in English eyes, that the
	American woman established in a foreign
	land rarely or never fails in either
	her admiration or her affection for her
	country across the sea.</p>

	<p>At the time of the Spanish-American
	War, this extreme loyalty to their native
	home and the land of their birth
	was made evident in not one but a
	dozen ways that never escaped the notice
	of English eyes. Expatriated
	though in a measure she is, the Anglicized
	American woman scarcely ever
	loses her sense of pride and profound
	satisfaction in being an American, after
	all, and so strong is this feeling in these
	delightful women that it is accepted
	quite as a matter of course, both by
	them and by their English friends, that
	their sons should frequently go back
	to the mothers’ land in order to find
	their wives.</p>

	<p>Two notable instances of the son’s
	love for his mother’s country and his
	instinctive interest in her countrywomen
	have been supplied in the marriages
	of the young Duke of Manchester and
	the son of Sir William and Lady Vernon-Harcourt.</p>

	<p>It seems scarcely more than natural
	that Mr. Lewis Vernon-Harcourt
	should marry pretty Miss Burns, of
	New York, though, through his mother
	as well as his father, all his interests and
	sympathies are naturally centered in
	England.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"> </a>Yet it is safe to say that when the
	average Englishman marries an American
	he does not feel in the least as
	though he was marrying, so to speak,
	outside the family circle.</p>

	<p>The marvelous adaptability of the
	American woman robs the situation of
	any difficulty, and in no way, so far, has
	the American wife of the Englishman
	showed more astonishing adaptability
	than in the cordial interest with which
	she often identifies herself with her husband’s
	political interests, if he is in Parliament.</p>

	<p>Three of the keenest politicians in
	petticoats that England possesses are
	American women by birth; and the first
	and leading spirit among them is the
	American wife of Mr. Chamberlain.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Chamberlain cares little or nothing
	for society, and beyond the obligatory
	functions at which she has been
	obliged to preside or attend, she shows
	small taste for the frivolities of that special
	world of men and women where
	the main task and occupation of every
	day is to amuse one’s self. But in the
	affairs of state she feels a very burning
	interest indeed.</p>

	<p>She is one of the two women in the
	British empire who are admitted by men
	to understand the mysterious and, to the
	average feminine mind, inexplicable fiscal
	problem; she knows all about tariff
	reform; she is her husband’s first secretary,
	confidante and adviser; she is
	said to be the most discreet lady in
	speech, where her husband’s political
	interests are concerned, and when he
	speaks in public Mrs. Chamberlain sits
	so near to him that, in case of a lapse of
	memory, she can play the part of stage
	prompter.</p>

	<p>Every one of his speeches she commits
	to memory, and can, therefore,
	give him any missing word at any critical
	moment, and in this way she is
	even more helpful than the capable and
	intellectual Lady Vernon-Harcourt was
	to her distinguished husband.</p>

	<p>There is still a third American woman
	to whose abilities her English husband
	is deeply indebted. This is Lady
	Curzon, who has very clearly defined
	diplomatic gifts, who is naturally highly
	ambitious, and who has, in her zeal to
	help her husband, learned to speak more
	East Indian dialects and Oriental
	tongues than any white woman in India.</p>

	<p>Fourth, perhaps, of this list should be
	mentioned Lady Cheylesmore, who was
	in her girlhood, spent at Newport and
	New York, so well known and admired,
	especially for her wonderful red hair,
	which Whistler loved to paint.</p>

	<p>Lady Cheylesmore was Miss Elizabeth
	French in those days, and now she
	is proud to be known as the wife of the
	mayor of Westminster, for her husband
	has lately been chosen for that very
	dignified position. As one of London’s
	lady mayoresses, she will dispense delightful
	hospitality in her handsome
	house in Upper Grosvenor Street, which
	is famous for its three wonderful drawing
	rooms, decorated by the Brothers
	Adam, and regarded by connoisseurs
	as one of the most perfect examples of
	their art and taste.</p>

	<p>At her dinner parties Lady Cheylesmore
	entertains many politicians of
	note, and in one way or another, by her
	infinite tact and good sense, does much
	to aid and abet her husband’s well-known
	aspirations to a brilliant parliamentary
	place.</p>

	<p>She is one of the ardently ambitious
	American women of whose very real
	and deserved triumphs we hear so much
	artistically as well as socially, these
	days. And let it be said here and now,
	to London’s credit, that there is no city
	in the world that gives to its resident
	daughters of Uncle Sam a heartier
	measure of praise and encouragement
	in all their accomplishments.</p>

	<p>We may, some of us, cherish high
	tariff principles and believe in restricting
	the immigration. None of us, however,
	is ready to vote for any measures
	that will bar out or discourage one class
	of fair and accomplished aliens who
	cross the ocean bent on conquering London,
	and who in the end are so often
	conquered in turn by London’s charm,
	and who settle down to form an element
	in our society that is fast becoming as
	familiar and as welcome as it is admirable
	and indispensable.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap8.png" width="122" height="118" alt="M" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Miss Allys Rhett</span>
	stood upon the clubhouse
	lawn, a vision in
	filmy white, smiling
	her softest, most enchanting
	smile. There
	was a reason for the
	smile—a reason strictly feminine, yet
	doubly masculine. She had walked
	down the steps that led from the <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">piazza</em>
	betwixt Rich Hilary and Jack Adair,
	the catches of the season, in full view
	of the Hammond girl, who was left to
	waste her sweetness upon prosy old
	Van Ammerer.</p>

	<p>The Hammond girl had been rather
	nasty all summer—she was, moreover,
	well known to be in hot pursuit of Rich
	Hilary. Until Allys came on the scene
	it had seemed the pursuit must be successful.
	They had gone abroad on the
	same steamer the year before, dawdled
	through a London season, and come
	home simultaneously—he rather bored
	and languid, she of a demure and downcast,
	but withal possessive, air. She had
	said they were not engaged—“oh, dear
	no, only excellent friends,” but looking
	all the while a contradiction of the
	words. Then unwisely she had taken
	Hilary to that tiresome tea for the little
	Rhett girl—and behold! the mischief
	was done.</p>

	<p>The little Rhett girl was not little;
	instead, she was divinely tall, and lithe
	as a young ash. No child, either. What
	with inclination and mother-wisdom,
	her coming out had waited for her to
	find herself. At nineteen she had found
	herself—a woman, well poised and
	charming as she was beautiful. Notwithstanding
	Hilary had not instantly
	surrendered—horse, foot and dragoons.
	Rather he had held out for terms—the
	full honors of war, as became a man
	rising thirty, and prospective heir to
	more millions than he well knew what
	to do with.</p>

	<p>Two or three of the millions had
	taken shape in the Bay Park, the newest
	and finest of metropolitan courses. Hilary’s
	father, a power alike on the turf
	and in the street, had built it, and controlled
	it absolutely—of course through
	the figment of an obedient jockey club.
	A trace of sentiment, conjoined to a
	deal of pride, had made him revive an
	old-time stake—the Far and Near. It
	dated back to that limbo of racing
	things—“before the war.” Banker Hilary’s
	grandfather, a leader among gentlemen
	horsemen of that good day, had
	been of those who instituted it—a fact
	upon which no turf scribe had failed to
	dilate when telling the glories of the
	course. The event was, of course, set
	down a classic—as well it might be,
	all things considered. The founders
	had framed it so liberally as to admit
	the best in training—hence the name.
	The refounders made conditions something
	narrower, but offset that by
	quadrupling the value.</p>

	<p>This was Far and Near day—with a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>record crowd, and hot, bright summer
	weather. The track was well known to
	be lightning fast, and the entry list was
	so big and puzzling that the Far and
	Near might well prove anybody’s race.
	There were favorites, of course, also
	rank outsiders. One heard their names
	everywhere in the massed throng that
	had overflowed the big stand, the lawn,
	the free field, and broken in human
	waves upon the green velvet of the infield.
	This by President Hilary’s own
	order. He had come to the track early,
	and looked to everything—with a result
	that there was no trouble anywhere.</p>

	<p>The crowd had been gayly demonstrative
	through the first two races. It
	had watched the third in tense silence—except
	that moiety of it ebbing and
	flowing through the clubhouse. It was
	the silence of edged patience. Albeit
	the early races were fair betting propositions,
	the most of those who watched
	them had come to lay wagers on some
	Far and Near candidate—and the Far
	and Near candidates had been getting
	their preliminaries.</p>

	<p>They numbered just nineteen. Seventeen
	had been out when Allys and her
	squires stopped under the shade of a
	tree. Notwithstanding the shadow, she
	put up her white parasol, tilting it at
	just the angle to make it throw her head
	and shoulders in high relief. Adair
	glanced at her, caught a hard breath,
	nipped it, then looked steadily down
	the course a minute.</p>

	<p>Hilary smiled—a smile that got no
	further than the corners of his red lips—his
	eyes, indeed, gloomed the more
	for it—then turned upon Allys with:
	“Pick the winner for us, won’t you?
	You are so delightful feminine you
	know nothing of horses, therefore ought
	to bring us luck. Say, now, what shall
	we back?”</p>

	<p>“It depends,” Allys said, twirling her
	parasol ever so lightly. “Do you want
	to lose? Or do you really care to win?”</p>

	<p>“To win, please, O oracle, if it’s
	all the same to you,” Hilary said, supplication
	in his voice, although his eyes
	danced.</p>

	<p>Allys gave him a long look. “Then
	you must take Heathflower,” she said.
	“I have the Wickliffe boy’s word for it—he
	wrote me only yesterday: ‘Miss
	Allys, if you want to get wealthy, bet
	all your real money on that Heathflower
	thing.’”</p>

	<p>“H’m! Who is the Wickliffe boy?
	Tell us that before we play his tip,”
	Adair demanded. Hilary could not
	speak for laughing.</p>

	<p>Allys smiled entrancingly. “The
	Wickliffe boy—is a knight-errant born
	out of time,” she said. “I’m wondering
	if it will last. We came to know
	him last summer—mother and I—down
	at Hollymount, my uncle’s place in Virginia.
	The <ins id="corr6" class="corr" title="Wickcliffe">Wickliffe</ins> boy, Billy by
	name, lives at Lyonesse, which is Hollymount’s
	next neighbor. It belongs to
	Billy’s uncle, the dearest old bachelor—maybe
	that is the reason the boy has
	such reverence for womankind. I don’t
	know which he comes nearest worshiping—women
	or horses. Whenever we
	rode out—he was my steadfast gallant—he
	managed somehow to pass through
	or by or around Haw Bush, where the
	Heathflower thing was bred. Old Major
	Mediwether, her owner, is Billy’s
	best chum. They match beautifully—though
	the major is nearly eighty, and
	Billy just my age—rising nineteen.”</p>

	<p>“They must have made it interesting
	for you. I’m sure you couldn’t tell half
	so much about either of us,” Adair
	said, with a deeply injured air.</p>

	<p>Allys shook her head at him. “They
	are dears,” she said, emphatically. “And
	they taught me a lot I should never have
	known—about horses and men.”</p>

	<p>“Anything specific—as about the
	Heathflower thing?” Hilary asked, affecting
	to speak with awe.</p>

	<p>Allys nodded. “A heap,” she said.
	“I can hear Billy now, as we watched
	her on the training track, saying: ‘She
	hasn’t got any looks—but legs are better
	for winnin’. And she must win;
	she’s bound to—whenever she feels like
	it, and the track and the weights suit
	her. She can’t help it—she’s got eight
	full crosses of Blink Bonny blood.’”</p>

	<p>“Blink Bonny! H’m! Who was he?
	What did he do?” Hilary asked.</p>

	<p>Allys looked at him severely. “‘He’
	happens to have been ‘she,’” she said.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"> </a>“As for the doing, it was only winning
	the Derby, with the Oaks right on top
	of it. Mighty few mares have ever
	done that—as you would know if you
	had grown up in Virginia, with time
	to know everything. Billy does know
	everything about pedigrees—he can reel
	them off at least a hundred years back.
	Remember, now, I’m strictly quoting
	him: ‘Blink Bonny is really ancient history—she
	won the year poor old Dick
	Ten Broek tried so hard to have his
	American-bred ones carry off the blue
	ribbon of the turf. He didn’t win it—no
	American did—until one of them
	had luck enough to try for it with something
	of Blink Bonny’s blood. Iroquois
	went back to her through his sire, Bonnie
	Scotland-Iroquois, who wasn’t really
	a great horse, but a good one that
	happened on a great chance.’”</p>

	<p>“Why, Allys darling, I can hardly
	believe my ears! Here you are talking
	horse like a veteran, when I always
	thought you didn’t know a fetlock from
	a wishbone,” the Hammond girl cooed,
	swimming up behind them on old Van
	Ammerer’s arm. They were headed
	for the paddock, although it was not
	quite time for the saddling bell. The
	Heathflower thing was still invisible—Allys
	searched the course for her
	through Hilary’s glass, saying the while
	over her shoulder, with her most infantine
	smile: “You thought right, Camilla
	dear. I don’t really <em>know</em> anything—have
	only a parrot faculty of repeating
	what I hear.”</p>

	<p>The Hammond girl flushed—that
	was what she had said of Allys when
	people laughed over the Rhett <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mots</em>.
	But before she could counter, Allys
	cried joyously: “At last! The Heathflower
	thing! Really, she hasn’t any
	looks—but see her run, will you?”</p>

	<p>“She does move like a winner—but
	it’s impossible she can stay,” Hilary
	said, almost arrogantly. “Pedigree is
	all very well—until it runs up against
	performance——”</p>

	<p>“Right you are! Quite mighty right,
	Rich, me boy,” old Van Ammerer interrupted.
	“But I didn’t know they let
	dark horses run in the Far and
	Near——”</p>

	<p>“Lucky you are young, Van—you
	have such a lot to learn,” Adair said,
	brusquely, as they went toward the
	paddock. It was thronged, but somehow
	at sight of Hilary the human
	masses fell respectfully apart—albeit
	the men and women there had forgotten
	themselves, even forgotten each
	other for the time being, in their poignant
	eagerness over the big race.</p>

	<p>They were hardly through the gate
	and well established in an eddy when
	the bell brought the racers pacing or
	scurrying in. The Heathflower thing
	came straight off the course, and stood
	spiritlessly, drooping her head and
	blinking her eyes. Clear eyes, matching
	the loose, satiny skin, beneath which
	whipcord muscles stood out, or played
	at each least motion, they told the eye
	initiate that she was in the pink of condition.
	Like her so-famous ancestors,
	a bay with black points, neither under
	nor over size, with a fine, lean head, a
	long neck, and four splendid legs, it
	was a marvel that she could so utterly
	lack any trace of equine comeliness.
	Her chest was noticeably narrow, her
	barrel out of proportion to shoulders
	and quarters. Still, against those patent
	blemishes, a judge of conformation
	would have set the splendid sloping
	shoulders, the reaching forearm, the
	bunches of massy muscle in the long
	loin, the quarters well let down into
	perfect houghs, the fine, clean bone of
	knees and ankles, the firm, close-grained
	hoofs spreading faintly from coronet
	to base.</p>

	<p>Clean-limbed throughout, with ears
	that, if they drooped, had no trace of
	coarseness and were set wide apart
	above a basin face, the mare showed
	race indisputably, notwithstanding the
	white in her forehead was too smudgy
	to be called a star, or that, though her
	muzzle tapered finely, the lower lip habitually
	protruded a bit. A four-year-old,
	she was still a maiden—consequently
	had but a feather on her back in
	the Far and Near. The handicapper
	had laughed, half wearily, half compassionately
	as he allotted it, muttering
	something about the jockey club robbing
	the cradle and the grave—that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>poor old Major Meriwether, it was well
	known, hadn’t any money to spare;
	what he did have was the gambler’s instinct
	to sit into any game where the
	stakes were big.</p>

	<p>The race was open to three-year-olds
	and upward, and run over a distance—two
	miles and a half. The distance kept
	out the sprinters—it also, now and
	again, played hob with racing idols. To
	win a horse must be able to go—also to
	stay. With twenty thousand of added
	money, there was sure to be always a
	long list of entries. The conditions held
	one curious survival from the original
	fixture—namely, that, horses brought
	over three hundred miles to run in it
	got a three-pound allowance if they
	reached the course less than a week before
	the day of the race.</p>

	<p>Major Meriwether had chuckled
	whenever he thought of that. He knew
	“the weight of a stable key may win or
	lose a race.” And the Heathflower
	thing was a splendid traveler, coming
	out of her padded stall as ready to run
	as when she went into it. She had got
	to the Bay Park only two days back, in
	charge of her rubber, Amos, and Black
	Tim, her jockey. Tim stood at her
	head, Amos was giving her lank sides
	their last polish, as Allys and her train
	swept down upon them.</p>

	<p>Allys nodded to them gayly, as she
	asked: “Tim, have you come up to
	break New York? I hear your stable
	will need a special car to take home its
	money—after the Far and Near.”</p>

	<p>“Yessum, dat’s so!” Tim said.</p>

	<p>Amos scowled at him, but said to Allys,
	respectfully: “Please’um, don’t ax
	dat dar fool boy no mo’ ’bout de Flower—hit’s
	mighty bad luck sayin’ whut
	you <em>gwine</em> do, ontwel you is done done
	it.”</p>

	<p>“Dar come Marse Billy Wickliffe—you
	kin ax him all you wanter.” Tim
	giggled, then clapped his hand over his
	mouth. Tim was lathy—long-legged,
	long-armed, with an ashy-black complexion
	and very big eyes. As he stood
	fondling the Flower’s nose, he glared
	disdain of all the other candidates, or,
	rather, of the knots of folk gathered admiringly
	about them.</p>

	<p>Allys turned half about—for two
	breaths at least she had a snobbish impulse
	to overlook Billy and hurry away.
	Billy was tall, with a face like a young
	Greek god—but how greet him there
	with the Hammond girl to see, in a
	checked suit, patently ready-made, with
	the noisiest of shirts, a flowing bright
	red tie, and a sunburned straw hat?
	If it were only Adair, she would not
	mind—Hilary was, she knew, very
	much more critical. She might have
	run away, but that she caught the Hammond
	girl’s look—amusement and satisfaction
	struggled through it, although
	the young lady tried hard to mask them.</p>

	<p>Allys turned wholly, holding out both
	hands, and saying: “Billy, by all that’s
	delightful! I’ve just been telling these
	people about you. Come, show them
	I kept well within the truth.”</p>

	<p>Billy caught the outstretched hands,
	his heart so openly in his eyes Hilary
	wanted to strangle him on the spot.
	The Hammond girl laughed, and
	turned to whisper in Van Ammerer’s
	ear. Adair, alone of the group, shook
	hands. Although the others gave him
	civil, if formal, greeting, Billy felt their
	hostility intuitively, and flung up his
	head like a stag at bay.</p>

	<p>“You got my note—have you done
	it yet?” he asked, bending over Allys in
	a fashion that made Hilary’s teeth set
	hard.</p>

	<p>She laughed back at him: “Have you
	done it yet? Bet your whole fortune on
	the Heathflower thing at a hundred to
	one?”</p>

	<p>Billy nodded confidently. “That’s
	just what I have done. Unc’ Robert
	was willin’—he thought as I did, such
	a little bit o’ money was better risked
	than kept.”</p>

	<p>“H’m! I hope you kept the price
	of a return ticket,” Hilary said, trying
	to speak jocularly. “Really, Mr.
	Wickliffe, you can’t think that ugly
	brute has a chance to be even in the
	money.”</p>

	<p>“My money’s talkin’ for me,” Billy
	said, facing Hilary. “’Tain’t much—only
	a thousand. Lordy! if I could,
	wouldn’t I burn up these ringsters!
	You ought to a-heard ’em, Miss Allys,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"> </a>when I went at ’em. ‘The Heathflower
	thing, did you say?’ the first one asked
	me. ‘Oh, say! do you want to rob us
	poor fellows? Couldn’t think of layin’
	you less’n a thousand to one on that
	proposition.’ But he cut it mighty
	quick to a hundred to one when I said:
	‘I’d take you for a hundred, only I know
	you couldn’t pay.’ Tell you he rubbed
	his slate in a hurry after I got down
	fifty. The next one tried to be smart
	as he was—sang out to some o’ the rest:
	‘Here’s the wild man from Borneo,
	come to skin us alive!’ Then made out
	he was skeered to death when I offered
	him one little pitiful rag of a ten. But
	when they saw me keep on right down
	the line, some of ’em shut up and
	looked a little anxious, some cut the
	price, and some got sassier than ever.
	They called me Rube, and Johnny-on-the-spot-of-wealth,
	and Shekels, and a
	heap of other things. But I didn’t
	mind. Still, next time I’ll send my
	money by one of those commissioner
	fellows. To-day I couldn’t risk it.”</p>

	<p>“What makes you so suddenly avaricious,
	Billy?” Allys asked. “Last summer
	you cared less for money than
	anything. There must be a reason—tell
	me, does it wear frocks?”</p>

	<p>“Not the special reason,” Billy said,
	with an adoring look; then in her ear:
	“I know you don’t care for money any
	more’n I do. But I’m bound to have
	some—if there’s any chance—it’s—it’s
	because of the major. I’ll tell you all
	about it, after the race.”</p>

	<p>The parade was nearly over when
	Allys and her three swains came again
	to the lawn. By some odd chance, the
	long shots had been well toward the
	head of it, leaving the two favorites
	and the three second choices to bring
	up the rear. The Heathflower thing
	was immediately in front of them. She
	had moved so soberly, plodding with
	low head and sleepy eyes, the watchers
	had given her an ironic cheer, mingled
	with cat calls. All the others had got
	a welcome more or less enthusiastic,
	but it was only when Aramis, even-money
	favorite, came through the paddock
	gate that the crowd got to its feet.</p>

	<p>All up and down, and round about,
	roaring cheers greeted him, followed
	him—men flung up their hats for him,
	women in shrill falsetto cried his name.
	Nobody could fail to understand that
	he carried the hopes and the fortunes
	of a great multitude. Nobody could
	fail to understand either that Aldegonde,
	who followed right on his heels,
	would win or lose for as many. The
	pair were blood-brothers, sons of the
	great Hamburg, but one out of an imported
	dam, the other from a mare tracing
	to Lexington, and richly inbred to
	that great sire.</p>

	<p>Still the line of cleavage was not
	patriotic nor even international. Folk
	had picked one or the other to win
	freakishly—on hunches of all sorts, tips
	of all manners, pure fancy, or “inside
	information” of the hollowest sort.
	As to looks, pedigree, or performance,
	there was hardly a pin to choose between
	the pair. Both were three-year-olds,
	tried in the fire of spring racing;
	both held able to go the distance and
	stay the route, in that they had won
	from everything except from each
	other.</p>

	<p>By some curious chance they had
	not met before that season—in their
	two-year-old form they had won and
	lost to each other.</p>

	<p>Thus to many onlookers the Far and
	Near held out a promise of such an
	equine duel as would make it the race
	of the century. And certainly two
	handsomer or gallanter beasts than the
	pair of raking chestnuts, long-striding,
	racelike, with white-starred faces and
	single white hind feet, never looked
	through a bridle.</p>

	<p>Notwithstanding, the second choices
	were far from friendless, albeit their
	greatest support was for the place or
	to show. The greeting they got was
	tame compared to that of the favorites,
	but still a volleying cheer, rising and
	falling along the quarter-mile of humanity
	banked and massed either side
	the course. Shrewd form players and
	the plainer sort had taken liberal fliers
	on them—that was evident by the way
	the shouting mounted in the free field,
	and the jam in front of the betting
	ring.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"> </a>Not a few of the professional layers
	had turned their slates and were out on
	watch for the event that would mean
	thousands in or out of their pockets.
	Among the second choices Artillery, the
	black Meddler mare, was held a shade
	the best. Next to her came Tay Ho,
	a son of Hastings, five years old, who
	might have divided honors with the
	favorites but for being an arrant rogue.
	To-day he ran in blinkers, and nodded
	the least bit in his stride, whereas his
	stable mate, Petrel, the last of the second
	choices, went as free as ever water
	ran.</p>

	<p>Billy watched the parade, scarcely
	conscious that Allys clung to his arm.
	Hilary stood at her other hand, frowning
	blackly. The finish line was almost
	in front of them.</p>

	<p>Hilary moved back a pace. “We can
	see better here,” he said, trying to draw
	Allys along with him. She shook her
	head obstinately, but said nothing; in
	her heart she was resolved that Billy
	should have the comfort of her presence
	in his hour of defeat.</p>

	<p>Since she was very far from being
	a model young person, Hilary’s manifest
	anger was not displeasing. She
	was going to marry him—but only at
	her own time, and upon her own conditions.
	So far, there was no engagement—she
	had fenced and played with him
	beautifully all through the last three
	months. He had no right whatever to
	be nasty about Billy; of course, if it
	were some grown-up body, Adair for
	example, there might be a color of reason
	for his wrath. He ought to understand
	that Billy was, in a way, her guest—also
	a person to whom she owed
	something in the way of hospitality.
	What provoked her most was knowing
	that Hilary was less jealous than
	ashamed—ashamed to have her thus
	openly countenance anybody who wore
	Billy’s clothes. She was all the angrier
	for her own moment of snobbishness—men
	ought to be above such paltry
	things, she reasoned; anyway, she was
	bound to stand by Billy to the inevitably
	bitter end.</p>

	<p>The start was tedious. Again and
	again the line of rainbow jackets drew
	taut across the course, only to break
	and tangle, and at last dissolve into its
	original gaudy units. Billy sighed as
	he watched it, then smiled shyly, and
	drew a long breath, saying in Allys’
	ear: “I hate to win except right square
	out.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t understand,” Allys returned.</p>

	<p>Billy looked at her in surprise.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you see—the favorites have
	got so much on their backs, the longer
	they wheel and turn, the more they take
	out of themselves?” he asked. “I’ll bet
	they are frettin’ like everything, too.
	See there! One of them chestnut-sorrels—can’t
	tell whether it’s Aramis or
	Aldegonde—is cuttin’ up high didoes.
	And the Heathflower thing standin’ like
	a little lamb——”</p>

	<p>“She may be standing there when the
	race is over,” Hilary interrupted.</p>

	<p>Billy did not put down his glass, but
	said over his shoulder: “Oh, I reckon
	Tim can stop her before she gets that
	far around. Don’t know, though—if
	she feels like runnin’ she’s a handful.
	And this is one of the days—I know,
	because she looks as though she
	couldn’t beat a funeral.”</p>

	<p>Allys pressed Billy’s arm—it was all
	she could do to show her enjoyment of
	the way he had turned things. Hilary
	bent toward her, saying, with a hard
	smile: “You seem to be on Mr. Wickliffe’s
	side—I wonder will you back his
	judgment?”</p>

	<p>“Maybe so,” Allys said, without
	turning her head. “That is, if you care
	to make it anything worth while. I’m
	not quite sure which I’d like best—a
	winter in Paris or a pearl necklace—and
	I know I shan’t ever get them at
	bridge—I have no luck at all.”</p>

	<p>“Give you millions against—just one
	word,” Hilary whispered; then aloud:
	“Is it a bet?”</p>

	<p>“Say yes, Miss Allys,” Billy entreated.
	“You ain’t trustin’ to my judgment—remember
	that—but to the blood of
	Blink Bonny.”</p>

	<p>“I take you up,” Allys said, nodding
	to Hilary. As well this way as any
	other, she thought—besides, she could
	hold him off as long as she chose. Her
	father would stand by her loyally—he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>was in no haste to see her established.
	Besides, this was what she had always
	craved—to watch a race with a heartrending
	wager on its event.</p>

	<p>“Here they come!” Billy shouted,
	dropping his glass, and flinging up his
	head.</p>

	<p>Up course the rainbow line had at
	last held steady, then, as the tape flew
	up, bellied out like a sail in gusty wind,
	and been rent into flecks and tatters.
	The lightweights, of course, were in the
	foremost of the flecks and tatters—all,
	that is, save the Heathflower thing, who
	came absolutely last. Tim’s orange
	jacket and scarlet sash were dust-dimmed
	by the time he came to the
	stand. But right in front of him were
	Aldegonde’s tiger stripes, black and
	yellow, and the blue and white in the
	saddle of Aramis.</p>

	<p>“Last all the way—eh, Miss Allys?”
	Adair said, leaning across Billy, who
	would have given back but that Allys
	clung to him in silence, her eyes glued
	to the glass, flushing and paling, her
	breath coming quicker even thus early
	in the race.</p>

	<p>There were open lengths all along—the
	lightweights were bent on making it
	a runaway race. Billy knew they could
	never do it. A horseman born and made,
	he marked their stride, and understood
	even better than their jockeys how
	much the killing pace was taking out of
	them. It did not astonish him that in
	the outstretch, before a mile had been
	run, three of the first flight chucked it
	up, falling back, back, till even the
	Heathflower thing showed them her
	heels. At the mile there were more
	counterfeits proven—as the race swept
	down upon the stand the second time
	there were but seven of the original
	contenders really in it. The rest were
	tailing hopelessly. One or two even
	pulled up. But the Heathflower thing
	was among the seven, and keeping
	place right behind the favorites.</p>

	<p>Allys clutched Billy’s arm so hard
	her fingers half buried in it. She was
	getting the thrills she had pined for
	with a vengeance, now that her freedom,
	her future, were to be colored by
	the issue of the race.</p>

	<p>The Heathflower thing could not win,
	of course; still, it was pure delight to
	have her so far redeem herself. If she
	was even near the real contenders at
	the finish, Billy’s faith would be justified.
	So many, at shorter odds, had already
	fallen out, there would be distinction
	in staying all the way.</p>

	<p>If the impossible happened, the
	Heathflower thing won, then she would
	have Hilary in a very proper frame of
	mind. Losing always hurt him dreadfully—it
	would be gall and wormwood
	to have lost to such a winner. She felt
	this rather than thought it—connected
	thought indeed was impossible in view
	of what was happening out on the
	course.</p>

	<p>In the outstretch, for the second time,
	Aramis shot forward like the arrow
	from a bended bow. He had been running
	under wraps—now thus far from
	home, his jockey, the most famous of
	them all, gave him his head, evidently
	thinking there would be but one horse
	in the race. All in a breath two open
	lengths showed between Aramis and
	the others; then Aldegonde with a
	mighty burst lapped the leader’s flank.
	Tay Ho was right behind—so close his
	backers set up a breathless shout. The
	Flower was still last, but strive, strain,
	stretch as the flying leaders might, they
	got no further away from her.</p>

	<p>Billy flung up his hat, then clapped
	his hand over his mouth and said,
	smotheredly:</p>

	<p>“See that, Miss Allys! Let her come
	into the stretch with just one breath
	more’n those fine fellows, and it’s all
	over but the cashin’ in.”</p>

	<p>“Billy, you’re an angel! I thought
	we were hopelessly beaten,” Allys
	breathed rather than said.</p>

	<p>Hilary’s mouth set. Adair, watching
	him narrowly, saw it also whiten when,
	at the second mile post, the three leaders
	swept the turn barely heads apart,
	with the Heathflower thing right on
	their heels. More than that, she was
	running strongly, easily, clearly not distressed,
	although Aramis, still leading,
	rolled the least bit.</p>

	<p>Could that leggy bay really stay the
	route? Was there any reason for the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>Wickliffe boy’s unreason? Was there
	also any chance for him?—there Adair
	stopped short, smiling a thought grimly
	to see how all unconsciously, all
	femininely, Allys drooped to Billy’s upright,
	youthful strength.</p>

	<p>Hilary likewise noted it—with a
	thumping heart that sent the color surging
	over his face. Habitually he held
	himself well in hand—it amazed and
	angered him to find himself thus swept
	beyond himself. To all of us come moments
	when instinct masters reason—the
	primal masculine instinct of possession
	told him he would win or lose his
	quicksilver sweetheart on the issue of
	this race.</p>

	<p>Now she had no thought of him—her
	eyes were only for the course,
	where four horses ran like a team as
	never any of them had run before. All
	through the first quarter of this fateful
	last half, they held each other safe, running
	side by side, stride for stride.</p>

	<p>At the furlong pole beyond, Tay Ho’s
	hooded head for the first time showed
	in front—only to be instantly eclipsed
	by the white star of Aldegonde. Aramis
	began to hang—the angry roar of
	his backers told he was out of it. Simultaneously,
	the jockeys sat down to ride—there
	was the cruel swish of catgut,
	the crueler prodding of steel. In the
	crowd a great hushed breath, like the
	sigh of a forest before the storm, told
	of tense heartstrings.</p>

	<p>Almost instantly the sigh changed to
	a shouted roar as Tay Ho dropped
	back level with Aramis, leaving Aldegonde
	and the Heathflower thing half a
	length to the good. But next breath
	the falterers came again—together they
	held their place, their way, four mighty
	masses of blood and bone, of breath and
	fire and stay, fighting it out every inch
	of the way, with a living sea roaring,
	shouting, cursing, crying encouragement
	on either hand.</p>

	<p>How they lay down to it! How they
	came up!</p>

	<p>Stretch and gather! Stretch and
	gather, the game and gallant foursome
	held to it. Now, for the first time, the
	Heathflower thing showed all that was
	in her. Even those who stood to lose
	fortunes felt that her whirlwind rush
	deserved to win.</p>

	<p>A hundred yards from the wire,
	whips still flying, rowels plowing furrows
	in satin coats, Aramis staggered,
	half stumbled, then fell back an open
	length.</p>

	<p>Tim flung away his whip, and leaned
	far over, lying almost flat upon the
	Flower’s neck to shout in her ear: “You
	see dat dar Mister Aldergown! Dee
	calls him bulldawg! Tote yosef, gal!
	Show ’im you’s bulldawg, too.” Perhaps
	the Flower resented the caution.
	Certainly, she hung a bit in the next
	stride. Tay Ho and Aldegonde, running
	either side of her, almost let in
	daylight between.</p>

	<p>The cheers, the roars, mounted in
	deafening volume. The Heathflower
	thing answered them by going down,
	down, till it seemed she lay quite flat on
	earth. And then she came up, up, with
	a leap so long, so lancelike, it recovered
	all she had lost. Again she thrust herself
	forward—the horses either side of
	her thrust as far.</p>

	<p>Twenty yards from home not one of
	the three was an inch to the good or the
	bad. Aldegonde’s jockey slashed his
	mount savagely—somehow, one blow
	of the whip fell on the Flower’s quarter—fell
	and won the race. With a
	sweep as of the wind she went away
	from it, and got her nose across the
	finish line three inches in front!</p>

	<p>A near thing. Anybody must admit
	that. So near the tumult died to a
	breathless hush. Hilary half turned
	about. “I’m going to the judges’ stand
	to see what won,” he said. “I saw Aldegonde
	first.”</p>

	<p>“I don’t know about that—but I
	reckon you won’t go,” Billy said, laying
	his hand upon Hilary’s arm.</p>

	<p>Hilary was furious. “Why not?” he
	demanded. He was no weakling, but
	somehow he could not get free of that
	impertinent young cub’s grip.</p>

	<p>“Oh, because you are—your father’s
	son,” Billy said, nonchalantly, then
	steadfastly, the lightness dying from
	face and voice: “I mean no disrespect,
	Mr. Hilary, but all of us have got to
	take account of human nature. We
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>may think we know what won—you
	and me—but it’s the judges’ business
	to say so—and ours to be satisfied with
	the sayin’. That’s only fair——”</p>

	<p>“Let go my arm!” Hilary said, in a
	hoarse whisper, his eyes murderous.</p>

	<p>Billy held him fast. “Not until you
	give me a gentleman’s word you won’t
	interfere,” he said.</p>

	<p>Allys looked at him amazed, enchanted.
	Here was no boy to be played
	with, petted and coaxed from his beliefs—rather
	a man standing for what
	he held the right with the fire and
	strength of youth.</p>

	<p>Adair caught Hilary on the other
	side, saying under breath: “Hold still,
	Rich! You must! The wild man from
	Borneo is right this time. It would be
	horribly bad form if you said a questioning
	word—and, anyway, the judges
	saw—what we did.”</p>

	<p>Hilary turned upon Billy a look that
	made Allys hide her eyes, but nodded
	shortly, and strode away, not toward
	the stand. Billy turned to shield Allys,
	until by the stunned silence falling on
	the course, he knew the boards were
	going up—with the Flower’s number
	at the top of them.</p>

	<p>Then he took the fence in front at a
	flying leap, and came to himself only
	when he had both arms about the Flower’s
	neck, his face pressed to it, and
	tears raining, as he whispered: “You
	won, lady! You had to! You wouldn’t
	let Haw Bush be sold over the major’s
	head. Hang the mortgages now—we’ll
	save him, you and I! And you shall
	never, never run another race!”</p>

	<p>As the Flower was led away to receive
	other flowers, the hideous horseshoe
	penalty of victory, the crowd was
	astounded to see in the middle of the
	course a tall youngster in loud plaids,
	leaping, shouting, hugging himself,
	laughing and crying in the same breath.</p>

	<p>And this was what he shouted: “The
	blood of Blink Bonny! Hurrah! hurrah!
	Beat it if you can! Hurrah for
	Haw Bush! For Major Meriwether!
	For Tim! For Blink Bonny! Hurrah!
	hurrah! hurrah!”</p>

	<p>Allys watched him, smiling roguishly.
	“Billy is ridiculously young,” she
	said to the constant Adair.</p>

	<p>Adair looked glum. He knew, and
	knew she knew, that the boy they had
	welcomed was of full man’s age—quite
	old enough, in fact, to be married.</p>

		<h2>“PLUG” IVORY AND “PLUG” AVERY</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Holman F. Day</p>
	</div>
	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap10.png" width="125" height="120" alt="I" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> was the queerest turnout
	that ever invaded
	Smyrna Corner.</p>

	<p>Even the frogs of
	Smyrna swamp at the
	edge of the village
	gulped back their pipings,
	climbed the bank for a nearer
	view, and goggled in astonished silence
	as it passed, groaning, in the soft and
	early dusk.</p>

	<p>’Twas a sort of van—almost a little
	house on wheels, with an elbow of stove
	funnel sticking out of one side. An old
	chaise top was fastened by strings and
	wire over a seat in front. Dust and
	mud covered everything with striated
	coatings, mask eloquent of wanderings
	over many soils. A cadaverous horse,
	knee-sprung and wheezy, dragged the
	van at the gait of a caterpillar.</p>

	<p>Under the chaise top was hunched
	an old man, gaunt but huge of frame,
	his knees almost to his chin. Long,
	white hair fluffed over his bent shoulders,
	and little puffs of white whiskers
	stood out from his tanned cheeks. A
	fuzzy beaver hat barely covered the
	bald spot on his head. The reins were
	looped around his neck. Between his
	hands, huge as hams, moaned and
	sucked and suffled and droned a much-patched
	accordion. The instrument lamented
	like a tortured animal as he
	pulled it out and squatted it together.
	To its accompaniment, the old man sang
	over and over some words that he had
	fitted to the tune of “Old Dog Tray,”</p>

	<p>“Plug” Ivory Buck sat outside the
	door of his “emporium” in Smyrna
	Corner, his chair tipped back comfortably,
	ankle roosting across his knee,
	his fuzzy stovepipe hat on the back of
	his head.</p>

	<p>The end of his cigar, red in the May
	dusk, was cocked up close to his left
	eye with the arrogant tilt that signified
	the general temperament of “Plug”
	Ivory. For almost fifty years a circus
	man, he felt a bland and yet contemptuous
	superiority to those who had passed
	their lives in Smyrna Corner. However,
	when his father had died at the
	ripe age of ninety-three—died in the
	harness, even while gingerly and thriftily
	knuckling along a weight into the
	eighth notch of the bar of the scoop
	scales—Ivory had come back as sole
	heir to store, stock and stand, a seventy-two-year-old
	black sheep bringing
	a most amazing tail behind him—no
	less than a band chariot, a half dozen
	animal cages, a tent loaded on a great
	cart, and various impedimenta of
	“Buck’s Leviathan Circus and Menagerie.”</p>

	<p>He trundled the array through the
	village’s single street, stored the gilded
	glories in the big barn on the old home
	place, with the euphemism of circus
	terminology changed the sign “A. Buck,
	General Store,” to “I. Buck, Commercial
	Emporium,” and there he had lived
	five years, keeping “bachelor’s hall” in
	the big house adjoining the store.</p>

	<p>Sometimes he dropped vague hints
	that he might start on the road again,
	displaying as much assurance of long
	years ahead as though he were twenty-one.
	It was a general saying in Smyrna
	Corner that a Buck didn’t think he was
	getting old until after he had turned
	ninety. The townspeople accepted
	Ivory as a sort of a wild goose of passage,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>called him “Plug” on account of
	his never varying style of headgear, and
	deferred to him because he had fifty
	thousand dollars tucked away in the
	savings bank at the shire.</p>

	<p>The May dusk became tawny in the
	west, and he gazed out into it discontentedly.</p>

	<p>“I wish them blamenation tadpoles
	shed their voices along with their tails,”
	he grumbled, with an ear to the frogs in
	the marsh. “They ain’t quite so bad
	when they get big enough to trill, but
	that everlasting yipping makes me lonesome.
	I’m a good mind to toss up this
	tenpenny nail and salt codfish business
	and get back to the sawdust once more.”</p>

	<p>There was a stir in a cage above his
	head, a parrot waddled down the bars,
	stood on his beak and yawped hoarsely:</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, gents! The old
	army game!”</p>

	<p>“If it wasn’t for you, Elkanah, I
	swear I should die of listening to nothing
	but frogs tuning up and swallows
	twittering and old fools swapping guff,”
	he went on, sourly, and then he suddenly
	cocked his ear, for a new note
	sounded faintly from the marsh.</p>

	<p>“I never knew a bullfrog to get his
	bass as early as this,” he mused, and
	as he listened and peered, the old horse’s
	head came slowly bobbing around the
	alders at the bend of the road. Above
	the wailing of the distant accordion he
	caught a few words as the cart wabbled
	up the rise on its dished wheels:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>Old horse Joe is ever faithful,</p>
			<p class="i4">O-o-o, o-o-o—ever true.</p>
			<p>We’ve been—o-o-o—wide world over,</p>
			<p class="i2">O-o-o, o-o-o, toodle-oodle—through.</p>
		</div>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Then a medley of dronings, and finally
	these words were lustily trolled with
	the confidence of one who safely
	reaches the last line:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>A bet-tur friend than old horse Joe.</p>
		</div>
	</blockquote>

	<p>“Whoa, there! Whup!” screamed
	the parrot, swinging by one foot.</p>

	<p>“Ain’t you kind of working a friend
	to the limit and a little plus?” inquired
	Buck, sarcastically. The old horse had
	stopped before the emporium, legs
	spraddled, head down and sending the
	dust up in little puffs as he breathed.</p>

	<p>“Joachim loves music,” replied the
	stranger, mildly. “He’ll travel all day
	if I’ll only play and sing to him.”</p>

	<p>“Love of music will be the death of
	friend Joachim, then,” commented
	Buck.</p>

	<p>“Is there a hostelry near by?” asked
	the other, lifting his old hat politely.
	With satirical courtesy Buck lifted his—and
	at that psychological moment the
	only plug hats in the whole town of
	Smyrna saluted each other.</p>

	<p>“There’s a hossery down the road a
	ways, and a mannery, too, all run by old
	Sam Fyles.”</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, gents,” rasped the
	parrot. “Twenty can play as well as
	one.”</p>

	<p>The man under the chaise top pricked
	up his ears and cast a significant look
	at the plug hat on the platform. Plug
	hat on the platform seemed to recognize
	some affinity in plug hat on the van, and
	there was an acceleration of mutual interest
	when the parrot croaked his sentence
	again.</p>

	<p>Buck tipped forward with a clatter of
	his chair legs and trudged down to the
	roadside. He walked around the outfit
	with an inquisitive sniffing of his
	nose and a crinkling of eyebrows, and
	at last set himself before the man of
	the chaise top, his knuckles on his hips.</p>

	<p>“Who be I?” he demanded.</p>

	<p>The stranger surveyed him for some
	time, huggling his head down in cowering
	fashion, so it seemed in the dusk.</p>

	<p>“You,” he huskily ventured, “are
	Buck’s Leviathan Circus and Menagerie;
	Ivory Buck, Proprietor.”</p>

	<p>“And you,” declared Buck, “are
	Brick Avery, inventor of the dancing
	turkey and captor of the celebrated infant
	anaconda—side-show graft with
	me for eight years.”</p>

	<p>He put up his hand, and the stranger
	took it for a solemn shake, flinching at
	the same time.</p>

	<p>“How long since?” pursued Buck.</p>

	<p>“Thirty years for certain.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, all of that. Let’s see! If I
	remember right, you threw up your
	side-show privilege with me pretty sudden,
	didn’t you?” His teeth were set
	hard into his cigar.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>The man on the van scratched a trembling
	forefinger through a cheek tuft.</p>

	<p>“I don’t exactly recollect how the—the
	change came about,” he faltered.</p>

	<p>“Well, <em>I</em> do! You ducked out across
	country the night of the punkin freshet,
	when I was mud bound and the elephant
	was afraid of the bridges. You
	and your dancin’ turkey and infant anaconda
	and a cage of monkeys that
	wasn’t yours and—<em>Her!</em>” He shouted
	the word. “What become of Her,
	Brick Avery?”</p>

	<p>He seized a spoke of the forewheel
	and shook the old vehicle angrily. The
	spoke came away in his hand.</p>

	<p>“Never mind it,” quavered the man.
	“We’re all coming to pieces, me and
	the whole caboodle. Don’t hit me with
	it, though!”</p>

	<p>He was eying the spoke in Buck’s
	clutch.</p>

	<p>“What did you steal her for, Brick
	Avery?”</p>

	<p>“There isn’t anything sure about her
	going away with me,” the other protested.</p>

	<p>Buck yanked away another spoke in
	his vehemence.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you lie to me,” he bawled.
	“There wasn’t telegraphs and telephones
	and railroads handy in them days, so
	that I could stop you or catch you, but
	I didn’t need any telegraphs to tell me
	she had gone away with handsome
	Mounseer Hercules, of the curly hair.”
	He snorted the sobriquet with bitter
	spite. “A girl I’d took off’n the streets
	and made the champion lady rider of—and
	was going to marry, and thought
	more of, damn yeh, than I did of all
	the rest of the world! What did ye do
	with her?”</p>

	<p>“Well, she wanted to go along, and
	so I took her aboard. She seemed to
	want to get away from your show, near
	as I could find out.” The giant hugged
	his knees together and blinked appealingly.</p>

	<p>“It must be a bang-up living you’re
	giving her,” sneered Buck, running his
	eye over the equipage. In his passion
	he forgot the lapse of the years and the
	possibility of changes.</p>

	<p>“Seems as if you hadn’t heard the
	latest news,” broke in Avery, his face
	suddenly clearing of the puckers of apprehension.
	“She never stuck to me
	no time. She didn’t intend to. She just
	made believe that she was going to
	marry me so that I would take her
	along. She run away with the sixteen
	hundred dollars I had saved up and
	Signor Dellabunko—or something like
	that—who was waiting for her on the
	road, and I haven’t seen hide nor hair
	of ’em since, nor I don’t want to, and
	I’ve still got the letter that she left me,
	so that I can prove what I say. She
	was going to do the same thing to you,
	she said in it, but she had made up her
	mind that she couldn’t work you so
	easy. It’s all in that letter! Kind of a
	kick-you-and-run letter!”</p>

	<p>In his agitation Buck broke another
	spoke from the crumbling wheel. The
	parrot cracked his beak against the
	cage’s bars and yawled:</p>

	<p>“It’s the old army game, gents!”</p>

	<p>“Hadn’t you just as soon tear pickets
	off’n the fence there, or something like
	that?” wistfully queried Avery. “This
	is all I’ve got left, and I haven’t any
	money, and I haven’t had very much
	courage to do anything since she took
	that sixteen hundred dollars away from
	me.” He scruffed his raspy palms on
	his upcocked knees. “I didn’t really
	want to run away with her, Ivory, but
	she bossed me into it. I never was no
	hand to stand up for my rights. Any
	one, almost, could talk me ’round. I
	wish she’d stuck to you and let me
	alone.” His big hands trembled on his
	knees, and his weak face, with its flabby
	chaps, had the wistful look one sees
	on a foxhound’s visage. “When did
	you give up the road?” he asked.</p>

	<p>“Haven’t given it up!” The tone
	was curt and the scowl deepened. “I’ve
	stored my wagons and the round-top
	and the seats, but I’m liable to buy an
	elephant and a lemon and start out
	again ’most any time.”</p>

	<p>The eyes of the old men softened
	with a glint of appreciation as they
	looked at each other.</p>

	<p>“I don’t suppose you have to,” suggested
	Avery, with a glance at the
	store.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>“Fifty thousand in the bank and the
	stand of buildings here,” replied Buck,
	with the careless ease of the “well-fixed.”
	“How do you get your three
	squares nowadays?”</p>

	<p>“Lecture on Lost Arts and Free Love
	and cure stuttering in one secret lesson,
	pay in advance,” Avery replied, listlessly.
	“But there ain’t the three squares in
	it. I wish I’d been as sharp as you are,
	and never let a woman whiffle me into
	a scrape.”</p>

	<p>“Nobody ever come it over me,” declared
	Buck, pride slowly replacing his
	ire, but he added, gloomily; “excepting
	her, and I’ve never stopped thinking
	about it, and I’ve never seen another
	woman worth looking at—not for me,
	even if she did come it over me.”</p>

	<p>“But she didn’t come it over you,” insisted
	Avery. “I’m the one she come it
	over, and look at me!” He made a
	despairing gesture that embraced all his
	pathetic appanage. “You are the one
	that’s come out ‘unrivaled, stupendous
	and triumphant,’ as your full sheeters
	used to say. If I was any help in steering
	her away I’m humbly glad of it, for
	I always liked you, Ivory.”</p>

	<p>This gradual shifting to the ground
	of the benefactor, even of the servile
	sort, was not entirely placating, as
	Ivory Buck’s corrugated brow still hinted,
	but the constant iteration of admiration
	for his marvelous shrewdness and
	good fortune was having its effect. The
	old grudge and sorrow that had gnawed
	at his heart during so many years
	suddenly shooed away. The pain was
	assuaged. It was like opodeldoc stuffed
	into an aching tooth. He felt as
	though he would like to listen to a lot
	more of that comforting talk.</p>

	<p>“Avery,” he cried, with a heartiness
	that surprised even himself, “you’re a
	poor old devil that’s been abused, and
	you seem to be all in.” He surveyed
	the wheezing horse and kicked another
	spoke from the yawning wheel.</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, crack ’em down,
	gents!” squalled the parrot.</p>

	<p>“If it wasn’t for Elkanah, there, to
	holler that to me, with an occasional
	‘Hey, Rube!’ I couldn’t stay in this
	Godforsaken place fifteen minutes.
	There’s no one here that can talk about
	anything except ensilage and new-milk
	cows. Now what say? Store your
	old traps along o’ mine, squat down and
	take it comfortable. I reckon that you
	and me can find a few things to talk
	about that really amount to something!”</p>

	<p>“I should hate to feel I was a burden
	on you, Ivory,” stammered Avery,
	gasping at the amazing generosity of
	this invitation. “If there’s any stutterers
	around here I might earn a little
	something on the side, perhaps.”</p>

	<p>“Me with fifty thousand in the bank
	and letting a guest of mine graft for a
	living? Not by a blame sight!” snorted
	Buck. “You just climb out and shut
	up and help me unharness old Pollyponeezus
	here.”</p>

	<p>Ten minutes afterward they had the
	canvas off the chariots and were inspecting
	them by lantern light, chattering
	old reminiscences and seeming almost
	to hear the “roomp-roomp” of the
	elephant and the snap of the ringmaster’s
	whip.</p>

	<p>To the astonishment of Smyrna Corner,
	two plug hats, around which
	wreaths of cigar smoke were cozily
	curling, blossomed on the platform of
	the emporium next morning, instead of
	one. The old men had thirty years of
	mutual confidences to impart, and set
	busily at it, the parrot waddling the
	monotonous round of his cage overhead
	and rasping:</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, gents! The old
	army game!”</p>

	<p>In two weeks “Plug” Ivory and
	“Plug” Avery were as much fixtures in
	the Smyrna scenery as the town pump.
	Occasionally of an evening the wail
	of the snuffling accordion wavered out
	over the village. Buck, his head thrown
	back and his eyes closed, seemed to get
	consoling echoes of the past even from
	this lugubrious assault on Melody, and
	loungers hovered at a respectful distance.
	No one dared to ask questions,
	and in this respect the old men differed
	from the town pump as features in the
	scenery.</p>

	<p>Before a month had passed the two
	had so thoroughly renewed their youth
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"> </a>that they were discussing the expense
	of fitting out a “hit-the-grit” circus,
	and were writing to the big shows for
	prices on superannuated or “shopworn”
	animals.</p>

	<p>It was voted that the dancing turkey
	and infant anaconda grafts were no
	longer feasible. Once on a time the
	crowds would watch a turkey hopping
	about on a hot tin to the rig-a-jig of a
	fiddle and would come out satisfied that
	they had received their money’s worth.
	A man could even exhibit an angleworm
	in a bottle and call it the infant
	anaconda, and escape being lynched.
	Brick Avery sadly testified to the passing
	of those glorious days.</p>

	<p>However, it was decided that a cage
	of white leghorn fowls, colored with
	aniline dyes, could be shown even in
	these barren times as “Royal South
	American Witherlicks”; that Joachim
	could be converted into a passable
	zebra, and “Plug” Avery still had in his
	van the celluloid lemon peel as well as
	the glass cube that created the illusion
	of ice in the pink lemonade. The village
	painter was set at work on the new
	gilding of the chariots in the big barn.</p>

	<p>“Even if we don’t really get away,”
	explained Buck, “it’s a good idea to
	keep the property from running down.”</p>

	<p>But the appearance of the new gilt
	inflamed their showmen’s hearts. An
	irresistible hankering to get a nearer
	sniff of the sawdust, to mix with the old
	crowd, induced Buck to send a card to
	a sporting paper, advertising for correspondence
	from bareback riders, tumblers,
	specialty people and privilege
	speculators, who wanted to join a “one-ring,
	chase-the-fairs road show—no
	first-raters.” He emphasized the fact
	that all personal interviews would be
	arranged later in New York City.</p>

	<p>“We don’t want anyone tracking
	down here,” he confided to Avery.
	“That would call the bluff. But we
	can get some letters that maybe will
	perk us up a little.”</p>

	<p>The letters came in bundles—letters
	long, short, earnest and witty—whiffs
	from the good old world of the dressing
	tent. And they were read and discussed
	on the emporium’s platform, and
	some were answered in non-committal
	style so as to draw out further correspondence,
	and all in all it was voted by
	both “Plugs” that a small amount of
	money invested in advertising certainly
	did produce its full worth of entertainment.</p>

	<p>But in the midst of these innocent attempts
	to alleviate <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</em> something else
	came along beside letters. It was a
	woman—a slim, wiry, alert woman.
	She clambered down from the stage one
	day, advanced trippingly to the platform
	and courtesied low before the two
	plug hats, her long, draggly plume bobbing
	against her rouged cheek. The
	two plug hats arose and were doffed.
	Then the three faced each other.</p>

	<p>“You don’t hold your ages as well as
	I do, boys,” she commented, after her
	sharp scrutiny.</p>

	<p>“It’s the old army game, gents!”
	screamed the parrot, excited by this
	new arrival, gay with her colors and
	her ribbons.</p>

	<p>“It’s Her!” gasped Plug Avery.</p>

	<p>“It’s Signory Rosy-elly!” choked
	Plug Avery.</p>

	<p>She came up and sat down between
	them on one of the platform chairs.</p>

	<p>“It was the longest time before I
	could place those names,” she chattered.
	“‘Buck &amp; Avery, Consolidated Aggregation,’
	says I to myself. ‘Buck &amp;
	Avery,’ I says. And, thinks I, them
	two old codgers must have gone to
	Kingdom Come, for I’m—let’s see—I’m
	twenty, or something like that, years
	younger than either of you, as I remember.”
	She poked each one jovially with
	her parasol.</p>

	<p>“‘Buck &amp; Avery,’ says I,” she went
	on, cheerfully oblivious of their grimness.
	“‘It’s their boys,’ I says, and so
	I came right along, for I need the job,
	and I couldn’t explain the romantic part
	in a letter. I was thinking I’d surely
	be taken on when I told Buck and Avery’s
	sons the romance. But I don’t
	have to tell <em>you</em>, boys.”</p>

	<p>She jocosely poked them again.</p>

	<p>“‘A little old!’ you say?”—they
	hadn’t said anything, by the way, but
	stood there with gaping, toothless
	mouths. “Not a bit of it for a jay-town
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>circuit. Of course, it isn’t a Forepaugh
	job for me now or else I wouldn’t be
	down here talking to Buck &amp; Avery.
	But I’m still good for it all—rings, banners,
	hurdles, rump-cling gallop and the
	blazing hoop for the wind-up. You
	know what I can do, boys. Remember
	old times. Give me an engagement for
	old-times’ sake.” She flashed at them
	the arch looks of a faded coquette.</p>

	<p>Buck, the poignancy of his ancient
	regret having been modified by his long
	course of consolation from the lips of
	Avery, was the first to recover. This
	faded woman, trying to stay time’s ravages
	by her rouge, displaced the beauteous
	image he had cherished so long in
	his memory.</p>

	<p>“Ain’t you ashamed to face us two?”
	he demanded. “You that run away and
	broke your promise to me! You that
	ruined me!” He patted his breast dramatically
	and shot a thumb out at
	Avery.</p>

	<p>“My sakes!” she cried. “You ain’t
	so unprofessional as to remember all
	that silliness against me, are you? I
	was only a girl, and you couldn’t expect
	me to love you—either of you. I’m a
	poor widow now,” she sighed, “and I
	need work. And here you have been
	laying up grudges against me—the two
	of you—all these years! What would
	your wives have said?”</p>

	<p>“We never got married,” replied the
	two, in mournful duet.</p>

	<p>But she wasn’t in a consoling mood.
	“You’re lucky!” she snapped. “I married
	a cheap, worthless renegade, who
	stole my money and ran away. He fell
	off a trapeze and broke his neck, and I
	was glad of it.”</p>

	<p>The look that passed between Plug
	Ivory and Plug Avery carried all the
	pith of the quotation: “The mills of the
	gods grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
	small.”</p>

	<p>“So am I,” grunted Buck, surlily.
	“No, I’m sorry he didn’t live to torment
	you. No, the only thing I’m really
	sorry about is that ’twas Brick Avery’s
	money he got away with.”</p>

	<p>Avery sighed.</p>

	<p>“But I want to say to you, Signory
	Rosy-elly,” continued Buck, with a
	burst of pride quite excusable, tipping
	his hat to one side and hooking his
	thumb into the armhole of his vest, “it
	wasn’t my money you got, and it never
	will be my money you’ll get. You just
	made the mistake of your life when you
	run away from me.”</p>

	<p>“He’s got fifty thousand dollars in
	the bank,” hoarsely whispered Avery,
	vicariously sharing in this pride of prosperity—the
	prosperity beyond her
	reach.</p>

	<p>“Uh-huh! Correct!” corroborated
	Buck, surveying her in increasing triumph.
	This moment was really worth
	waiting through the years for, he reflected.</p>

	<p>“Twenty can play as well as one,”
	croaked the parrot, his beady eye
	pressed between the bars of his cage.</p>

	<p>The signora glanced up at this new
	speaker, eyed Elkanah with a sage look
	that he returned, and then, after a moment’s
	reflection, said:</p>

	<p>“Thanks for the suggestion, old chap.
	That is to say, three can play as well
	as two, when there’s fifty thousand in
	the bank. Buck, you know I’m always
	outspoken and straight to the point.
	No underhanded bluff for me. I’m going
	to sue you for ten thousand.”</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, gents!” remarked
	Elkanah, grimly.</p>

	<p>Buck cast a malevolent look at the
	bird, and then, his cigar tip-tilted and
	the corner of his mouth sarcastically
	askew, suggested with an air as though
	the idea were the limit of satiric impossibility:</p>

	<p>“I want to know! Breach of promise,
	I per-sume!”</p>

	<p>“Good aim! You’ve rung the bell,”
	rejoined the lady, coolly.</p>

	<p>The unconscionable impudence of the
	bare suggestion fetched a gasp from
	both men. Plug Ivory’s assumption
	of dignity crumbled immediately. The
	years rolled back. He felt one of those
	old-time fits of rage come bristling up
	the back of his head, the fury of old
	when he had tried to wither that giddy
	creature in his spasms of jealousy. But
	now, as in the past, her calm assurance
	put him out of countenance and his wild
	anathemas died away in sputterings.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>“I know all that, Ivory Buck,” she
	said, icily. “But how are you going to
	prove I was married? Where are you
	going to hunt for witnesses? Professional
	people are like wild geese—roosting
	on air and moulting their names
	like feathers. What proof of anything
	are you going to find after all these
	thirty years? While I—I’ve got your
	letters, every one—all your promises.
	Observe how I take my cue! Jury a-listening!
	I’ve been hunting the world
	over for you. You hid here. Here I
	find you—this poor, deserted woman,
	whose life has been wrecked by your
	faithlessness, finds you. Me, with a
	crape veil, a sniff in my nose, a crushed-creature
	face make-up, a tremolo in
	my voice and a smart lawyer such as I
	know about! What can you two old
	fools say to a country jury to block my
	bluff? Why, you can save money by
	handing me your bank book!”</p>

	<p>In his fury Buck grabbed her chair
	and tipped it forward violently in order
	to dump her off his sacred platform.
	She fled out into space with a
	flutter of skirts, landed lightly as a cat
	and pirouetted on one toe, crooking her
	arms in the professional pose that appeals
	for applause.</p>

	<p>“This is the first time Signora Rosyelli,
	champion bareback rider, ever tried
	to ride a mule,” she chirped, “but you
	see she can do it and make her graceful
	dismount to the music of the band.”</p>

	<p>Several villagers across the road
	were gaping at the scene. She inquired
	the way to the tavern, one of them took
	her valise, and she went down the road,
	tossing a kiss from her finger tips toward
	the two plug hats. Plug hats
	watched her out of sight and then
	turned toward each other with simultaneous
	jerk.</p>

	<p>“Don’t that beat tophet and repeat?”
	they inquired, in exact unison.</p>

	<p>“What are you going to do?” asked
	Plug Avery.</p>

	<p>“Fight her! Fight her clear to the
	high, consolidated supreme court aggregation
	of the United States, or
	whatever they call it!” roared Plug
	Ivory.</p>

	<p>“Nobody has ever beat her yet, except
	Dellybunko, and we ain’t in his
	class,” sighed Avery, despondently.</p>

	<p>“You don’t think, do you, that I’m
	going to lap my thumb and finger and
	peel her off ten thousand dollars?”</p>

	<p>“Why don’t you and she get married
	and we’ll all live here, happy, hereafter?”
	wistfully suggested Avery. “If
	it was in a book it would end off like
	that—sure pop.”</p>

	<p>“This ain’t no book,” replied Buck,
	elbows on his knees, eyes moodily on
	the dusty planks.</p>

	<p>“So you’re bound to go to court?”</p>

	<p>“Low court—high court—clear to
	the ridgepole—clear to the cupoly, and
	then I’ll shin the weather vane with the
	star spangled banner of justice between
	my teeth.”</p>

	<p>“I heard a breach of promise trial
	once,” related Avery, half closing his
	eyes in reminiscence, “and it was the
	funniest thing I ever listened to. ‘Twas
	twenty years ago, and I’ll bet that the
	people down there laugh yet when they
	see that fellow walk along the street.
	Them letters he wrote was certainly the
	squashiest—why, every one of them
	seemed to woggle like a tumbler of
	jelly—sweet and sloppy, as you might
	say! It being so long ago, when you
	was having your spell, I don’t suppose
	you remember just what you wrote to
	her, do you?”</p>

	<p>Avery still gazed at the same knothole,
	but a hot flush was crawling up
	from under his collar. He took off his
	plug hat and scuffed his wrist across
	his steaming forehead.</p>

	<p>“I remember that he called her ‘Ittikins,
	Pittikins, Popsy-sweet.’ Thought
	I’d die laughing at that trial! Did you
	sling in any names like that, Ivory?
	You being so prominent now and settled
	down and having money in the
	bank, them kind of names, if you wrote
	mushy like that, will certainly tickle
	folks something tremendous.”</p>

	<p>A student in physiognomy might
	have read that memory was playing
	havoc with Buck’s resolution. Avery
	was knitting his brows in deep reflection,
	knuckling his forehead.</p>

	<p>“Seems as if,” he went on, slowly,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"> </a>“she told me you called her something
	like ‘Sweety-tweety,’ or ‘Tweeny-weeny
	Girlikins’—something like that. How
	them newspapers do like to string out
	things—funny kind of things, when a
	man is prominent and well known, and
	has got money in the bank! Folks can’t
	help laughing—they just naturally
	can’t, Ive! You’ll be setting there in
	court, looking ugly as a gibcat and her
	lawyer reading them things out. Them
	cussed lawyers have a sassy way
	of——”</p>

	<p>Buck got up, kicked his chair off
	onto the ground, and in choler uncontrollable,
	clacked his fists under Avery’s
	nose and barked:</p>

	<p>“Twit me another word—just one
	other word—and I’ll drive that old nose
	of yourn clear up into the roof of your
	head!”</p>

	<p>Then he locked his store door and
	stumped away across the field to the big
	barn, where the remains of Buck’s Leviathan
	Circus reposed in isolated state.</p>

	<p>No one knows by just what course of
	agonized reasoning he arrived at his
	final decision, but at dusk he came back
	to the store. With the dumb placidity
	of some ruminant, Avery was sitting in
	his same place on the platform of the
	emporium.</p>

	<p>“Brick,” said Ivory, humbly, “I’ve
	been thinking back and remembering
	what I wrote to her—and it’s all of it
	pretty clear in my mind, ’cause I never
	wrote love letters to anyone else. And
	I can’t face it. I couldn’t sit in court
	and hear it. I couldn’t sit here on this
	platform in my own home place and
	face the people afterward. I couldn’t
	start on the road with a circus and have
	the face to stand before the big tent
	after it and bark like I used to. They’d
	grin me out of business. I’d be backed
	into the stall. No, I can’t do it. Go
	down and see what she’ll compromise
	on.”</p>

	<p>Avery came back after two hours and
	loomed in the dusk before the platform.
	He fixed his eyes on the plug hat that
	was still lowered in the attitude of despondency.</p>

	<p>“I wrassled with her, Ivory, just the
	same as if I was handling my own
	money, and I beat her down to sixty-six
	hundred. She won’t take a cent less.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll tell you what that sounds like to
	me,” snarled Buck, after a moment of
	meditation. “It sounds as if she was
	going to get five thousand and you was
	looking after your little old sixteen
	hundred.”</p>

	<p>A couple of tears squeezed out and
	down over Avery’s flabby cheeks.</p>

	<p>“This ain’t the first time you’ve misjudged
	me, when I’ve been doing you a
	favor,” said he. “And it’s all on account
	of the same mis’able woman that
	I’m misjudged—and we was living so
	happy here, me and you. I wish she
	was in——” His voice broke.</p>

	<p>“I ain’t responsible for what I’m
	saying, Avery,” pleaded Buck, contritely.
	“You know what things have happened
	to stir me up the last few hours—yes,
	all my life, for that matter. I ain’t
	been comfortable in mind for thirty
	years till you come here and cheered
	me up and showed me what’s what. I
	appreciate it and I’ll prove that to you
	before we’re done. We’ll get along together
	all right after this. All is, you
	must see me through.”</p>

	<p>Then the two plug hats bent together
	in earnest conference.</p>

	<p>The next morning Avery, armed with
	an order on the savings bank at the
	shire for six thousand six hundred dollars,
	and with Buck’s bank book in his
	inside pocket, drove up to the door of
	Fyles’ tavern in Buck’s best carriage,
	and Signora Rosyelli flipped lightly up
	beside the peace commissioner.</p>

	<p>He was to pay over the money on
	the neutral ground at the shire, receive
	the letters, put her aboard a train and
	then come back triumphantly into that
	interrupted <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum dignitate</em> of
	Smyrna Corner.</p>

	<p>For two days a solitary and bereaved
	plug hat on the emporium’s platform
	turned its fuzzy gloss toward the bend
	in the road at the clump of alders. But
	the sleek black nose of Buck’s “reader”
	did not appear.</p>

	<p>On the third day the bank book arrived
	by mail, its account minus six
	thousand six hundred dollars, and between
	its leaves a letter. It was an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"> </a>apologetic letter, and yet it was flavored
	with a note of complaint. Brick Avery
	stated that after thinking it all over he
	felt that, having been misjudged cruelly
	twice, it might happen again, and being
	old, he could not endure griefs of
	that kind. He had supported the first
	two, but being naturally tender-hearted
	and easily influenced, the third might be
	fatal. Moreover, the conscience of
	Signora Rosyelli had troubled her, so
	he believed, ever since the affair of the
	one thousand six hundred dollars. So
	he had decided that he would quiet her
	remorse by marrying her and taking
	entire charge of her improved finances.
	In fact, so certain was he that she
	would waste the money—being a woman
	fickle and vain—that he had insisted
	on the marriage, and she, realizing her
	dependence on his aid in cashing in, assented,
	and now he assured her that as
	her husband he was entitled to full control
	of their affairs—all of which, so
	the letter delicately hinted, was serving
	as retribution and bringing her into a
	proper frame of mind to realize her
	past enormities. The writer hoped that
	his own personal self-sacrifice in thus
	becoming the instrument of flagellation
	would be appreciated by one whom he
	esteemed highly.</p>

	<p>They would be known at the fairs as
	Moseer and Madame Bottotte, and
	would do the genteel and compact gift-sale
	graft from the buggy—having the
	necessary capital now—and would accept
	the buggy and horse as a wedding
	present, knowing that an old friend
	with forty-three thousand four hundred
	dollars still left in the bank would not
	begrudge this small gift to a couple
	just starting out in life, and with deep
	regard for him and all inquiring
	friends, they were, etc.</p>

	<p>In the more crucial moments of his
	life Buck had frequently refrained from
	anathema as a method of relief. Some
	situations were made vulgar and matter-of-fact
	by sulphurous ejaculation.
	It dulled the edge of rancor brutally, as
	a rock dulls a razor.</p>

	<p>Now he merely turned the paper
	over, took out a stubby lead pencil,
	licked it and began to write on the blank
	side, flattening the paper on his bank
	book.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>	FOR SALE—1 Band Wagon, 1 Swan
		Chariot, 3 Lion Cages.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>He paused here in his laborious
	scrawl and, despite his resolution of silence,
	muttered:</p>

	<p>“It’s going to be a clean sale. I don’t
	never in all my life want to hear of a
	circus, see a circus, talk circus, see a
	circus man——”</p>

	<p>“Crack ’em down, gents!” squalled
	the parrot. It was the first time for
	many hours that he had heard his master’s
	voice, and the sound cheered him.
	He hooked his beak around a wire and
	rattled away jovially. He seemed to
	be relieved by the absence of the other
	plug hat that had been absorbing so
	much of the familiar, beloved and original
	plug hat’s attention.</p>

	<p>Ivory looked up at Elkanah vindictively
	and then resumed his soliloquy.</p>

	<p>“No, sir, never! Half of circusing
	is a skin game all through—and I’ve
	done my share of the skinning. But to
	be skinned twice—me, I. Buck, proprietor—and
	the last time the worst,
	but——”</p>

	<p>“Twenty can play it as well as one!”
	the parrot yelled, cocking his eye over
	the edge of the cage.</p>

	<p>It was an evil scowl that flashed up
	from under the plug hat, but Elkanah
	in his new joy was oblivious.</p>

	<p>“Me a man that’s been all through it
	from A to Z—my affections trod on, all
	confidence in females destroyed and
	nothing ahead of me all the rest of my
	life! No, sir, I never want to hear of a
	circus again. Bit by the mouths I fed—and
	they thumbing their noses at me.
	That trick——”</p>

	<p>“It’s the old army game!” squealed
	the parrot, in nerve-racking rasp.</p>

	<p>Ivory Buck arose, yanked the bottom
	off the cage, caught the squawking bird,
	wrung his neck, tossed him into the
	middle of the road, and then, sucking
	his bleeding finger, went on writing the
	copy for his advertisement.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap11.png" width="122" height="120" alt="I" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> isn’t at all pleasant
	to burn one’s fingers,
	but it’s worth while
	burning them now and
	then, if you have to be
	scorched to be near a
	particularly attractive
	fire; at least I’ve found it that way.
	All of which leads me to Natica Drayton—Melsford
	that was.</p>

	<p>I think I’m the only one of the crew
	she dragged at her heels who hasn’t
	forgot about things and gone off after
	other game; some of them have been
	lashed to the burning stake of pretty
	uncomfortable domesticity, too. As for
	me—well, I’ve simply gone on caring,
	and I think I shall always go on.</p>

	<p>Does she know it? Of course she
	knows it; always has known it, ever
	since that first summer at Sacandaga.
	Not that I’ve been ass enough to say
	anything after the first time. I’m only
	an ordinary sort of chap when it comes
	to intuition, but somehow I’ve never
	plucked up the cheek to do any talking
	about my own miserable self; not since
	she let me down as gently as she could,
	while I paddled her back from Birch
	Point to the canoe house, with Elephant
	Mountain ragged-backed in the moon-haze.
	For the life of me I couldn’t tell
	you what it was she said. There was
	the drip of water from the paddle as I
	lifted it, stroke after stroke; the tiny
	hiss of smother at the prow, and
	twisted through it all, like a gathering
	string, Natica Melsford’s voice, letting
	me down easy—as easily as she
	could.</p>

	<p>After I had made fast, I remember
	feeling that somehow the moonlight
	had turned things extremely cold; and
	I reached for my sweater that lay in the
	stern. I also laughed a great deal too
	much around the logs at the bungalow
	fire, and then drank a deal more than
	too much at the clubhouse before turning
	in. Maybe it was cowardly to sneak
	back to town a couple of days later, “on
	business,” of course—a shabby excuse
	for a chap that doesn’t dabble in business
	more than I do. But I honestly
	needed to go to get back my equilibrium.
	I got it, though, and I’ve kept it
	pretty continuously. And this much is
	enough for that. Natica Melsford is
	the only interesting bit about this story,
	and let’s get back to her.</p>

	<p>That winter she married Jack Drayton.
	The afternoon we rehearsed for
	the wedding I looked at her, before we
	pranced down the aisle and endured the
	endless silly giggles of the bridesmaids,
	and the usher louts who would fall out
	of step, and grew more peevish by the
	minute. I looked her over then, and I
	said to myself: “You feeble paranoiac,
	imagine that girl tying up with <em>you</em>.”
	Well, I couldn’t very well imagine it,
	although I tried. But I was extremely
	noisy, and I heard two or three of the
	bridesmaids, to say nothing of the maid
	of honor and the bridegroom’s mamma,
	tapping their gentle hammers, at my expense,
	at the breakfast. It was a year
	afterward that I began to fag regularly
	for the Drayton establishment.</p>

	<p>Jack Drayton, by rights, ought to
	have been poisoned. He’d be the first
	to acknowledge it now. Perhaps if he’d
	married a girl who insisted on having
	things out the moment they began, the
	things wouldn’t have happened. But
	<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"> </a>Natica Melsford wasn’t that sort. She
	was the kind that simply looked scorn
	into and clear through you, when she
	thought you were acting low down.
	This, with a man strung like Jack was,
	simply put the fat into the fire. It would
	have been different with me. I’d—well—I’d
	have made an abject crawl, to be
	sure. You see, her knowing this was
	the thing that must have always
	queered me with her. A woman prefers
	a man she can get furious at and
	who’ll stick it out a bit, to one who
	caves in at the first sign of a frown.
	But Jack carried things too far.</p>

	<p>No, he didn’t mind my frequenting
	the house. He liked me and I liked
	him. But, all the same, I knew he
	didn’t regard me as a foeman worthy of
	his steel. And, although the knowledge
	made me raw now and then, when he’s
	come in with his easy, careless way, still
	I swallowed the mean feeling because
	it gave me a chance to see her. And
	don’t imagine I went around hunting
	for trouble. It was at the club one
	night—I’d just come from the Draytons,
	and Jack hadn’t been home to dinner—that
	I heard Rawlins Richardson
	and Horace Trevano chattering about
	Maisie Hartopp. The “Jo-Jo” song
	had made the biggest kind of a hit that
	winter at the Gaiety, and the hit had
	been made by the Hartopp singing it
	to a stage box which the Johnnies
	scrambled to bid in nightly.</p>

	<p>It seemed like small game for Jack
	Drayton to be trailing along with the
	ruck—the ruck meaning Tony Criswold
	and the rest of that just-out-of-college
	crew—but I didn’t need signed affidavits,
	after five minutes of club chatter,
	to know that he was pretty well tied to
	an avenue window at Cherry’s after the
	show. The Ruinart, too, that kept
	spouting from the bucket beside it, was
	a pet vintage of the Hartopp.</p>

	<p>There was a lot of that silly chuckle,
	and I recalled reading somewhere that
	there was a husband belonging to the
	Hartopp, a medium good welterweight,
	who picked up a living flooring easy
	marks for private clubs at Paterson, N.
	J., and the like, and occasionally serving
	as a punching bag for the good uns
	before a championship mill. What the
	devil was there to do? I couldn’t answer
	the riddle.</p>

	<p>It sounds like old women’s chatter,
	the meddlesome way I scribble this
	down. It would take a real thing in
	the line of literature to paint me right,
	anyway, I fancy. When a third party
	keeps mixing in with husband and wife,
	he deserves all the slanging that’s coming
	to him; which same is my last
	squeal for mercy.</p>

	<p>A month went by—two of them.
	Natica Drayton wasn’t the strain that
	needs spectacles to see through things.
	Then, too, I guessed the loving friend
	sympathy racket was being worked by
	some of the bridge whist aggregation
	which met up with her every fortnight.
	She laughed more than she ought to
	have done. This was a bad sign with
	her. Once or twice, when the three of
	us dined together, and she was almost
	noisy over the benedictine, I could have
	choked Jack Drayton, for he didn’t see.
	It’s not a pretty thing for an outsider
	to sit <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à trois</em>, and see things in a wife’s
	manner that the husband doesn’t or
	won’t see; and worse than that, to know
	that the wife knows you see it and that
	he doesn’t. Speak to Jack? I wouldn’t
	have done it for worlds. As I said, I’m
	willing to burn my fingers and even
	cuddle the hurt; but I don’t meddle
	with giant firecrackers except on the
	Fourth of July, and that didn’t come
	until afterward.</p>

	<p>I was to take her to the opera one
	night—Drayton had the habit of dropping
	in for an act or two and then disappearing—but
	on her own doorstep
	she tossed off her carriage wrap and
	sent Martin back to the stables.</p>

	<p>“Let’s talk, instead,” she said, and
	she made me coffee in the library, with
	one of those French pots that gurgle
	conveniently when you don’t exactly
	know what to say. That pot did a heap
	of gurgling before we began to talk.
	When she spoke, what she said almost
	took me off my chair.</p>

	<p>“Percy, have you seen the show at
	the Gaiety?” she asked.</p>

	<p>I had seen it more than once, and I
	said so.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"> </a>“They tell me there’s a song
	there——” she went on.</p>

	<p>“There are a lot of songs,” said I.</p>

	<p>“There’s one in particular.”</p>

	<p>There wasn’t any use in fencing, so
	I answered: “You mean the ‘Jo-Jo’
	song. It’s a silly little ditty, and it’s
	sung by——”</p>

	<p>“A girl named Hartopp—Maisie
	Hartopp.” She was speaking as if she
	were trying to remember where she’d
	heard the name.</p>

	<p>Of course, me for the clumsy speech.
	“She’s a winner,” I cut in.</p>

	<p>She got up at that, and walked over
	to the fireplace. “She seems to be,” she
	said, picking at a bit of bronze, a wedding
	present, I think. Then she came
	over to where I was sitting and put a
	hand on my shoulder. I’d have got to
	my feet if I hadn’t been afraid to face
	her. “Percy——” she began, and I felt
	the fingers on my shoulder quiver. I
	don’t think the Apaches handed out anything
	much worse in the torture line
	than the quiver of a woman’s ringers
	upon your shoulder, when you know
	that those fingers aren’t quivering on
	your account. Maybe that occurred to
	her, for a second later she took her hand
	away. “You once said something foolish
	to me, Percy,” she said.</p>

	<p>I nodded my head, my eyes upon
	an edge of the Royal Bokhara. “It was
	in a canoe, wasn’t it?” I replied. “There
	was a moon, of course, and the paddle
	blades went drip, drip.”</p>

	<p>“You meant what you said then,
	didn’t you?”</p>

	<p>My gaze was wavering from the rug
	by now. Little wonder, was it? “I
	meant it all right,” I got out after a
	while. “Do you want to hear me say
	my little speech over again?” Was it
	possible that, after all, Natica Drayton
	had really decided to toss Jack over,
	and take on a fag, warranted kind and
	gentle, able to be driven by any lady?
	But I forgot that foolish notion pretty
	nearly right off.</p>

	<p>“There is a husband,” she went on,
	as if taking account of stock.</p>

	<p>“There always is,” I rejoined. “Some
	of ’em are good and the others are
	bad.” I chuckled despite me, as I put
	in my mean little hack.</p>

	<p>“I mean the Hartopp’s husband,” she
	explained.</p>

	<p>“There is,” I said. “‘Boiler-plate’
	Hartopp. His given name is James,
	and he prize-fights fair to middling.”
	All this wasn’t quite good billiards, but
	we’d begun wrong that night, and we
	might as well keep it up, thought I.</p>

	<p>Natica Drayton was tapping her foot
	upon the fender. “H’m,” she mused.
	“Some of those horrid names sound interesting.”
	Then she turned to me
	abruptly. “I think, perhaps, you ought
	to go now,” she suggested.</p>

	<p>“I think so, too,” I agreed, rising
	very hastily, and taking my leave.</p>

	<p>“Have you Friday evening disengaged?”
	She flung this after me before
	I had got to the hall.</p>

	<p>“Yes,” said I, all unthinking.</p>

	<p>“Then we’ll do it Friday,” she said.</p>

	<p>“We’ll do what?” I asked, coming
	back to her. For once I felt rebellious,
	and showed it, whereat she smiled.</p>

	<p>“Supper after the theater at Cherry’s.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, well, I don’t mind that,” I volunteered.</p>

	<p>“With ‘Boiler-plate’ Hartopp,” she
	added.</p>

	<p>The searchlight dawned upon me. It
	swung around the room once or twice,
	and that was enough. I knew in the
	flood of sudden illumination that the
	girl had planned this thing in advance,
	with the daring of despair—and a wife’s
	despair, a very young wife’s despair, is
	a more desperate thing than the anger
	of any other woman. Natica had
	planned it all in advance; had figured
	it, and the chances of it. And in the
	balance she had confidently thrown the
	asset of my assisting her.</p>

	<p>The right sort of a man, I suppose,
	would have become enraged because
	of her taking things for granted. But
	I—I had been chained to her chariot too
	long a time to experience the mild sensation
	of resentment.</p>

	<p>Natica wished to face her husband
	in a crowded restaurant after the play.
	More than that, she wished to face him
	in company with a man not of her sort,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"> </a>even as he—Drayton—was escorting
	a woman whose lane of living did not
	rightly cross his. The coincidence of
	Natica’s means-to-an-end being the
	Hartopp’s husband, was simply a gift
	of fate; an opportunity of administering
	poetic justice, which could not be
	denied. Had the Hartopp not possessed
	a convenient husband, Natica
	would have arranged for another companion.
	But even she had not dared to
	plan her <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</em> alone, with her chosen instrument
	of wifely retaliation. Through
	it all, she had confidently counted on
	me, a discreet background, a pliant puppet.</p>

	<p>She could not know what Drayton
	might do, after they had eyed one another
	from different tables. She did
	not much care. But she would at least
	have the painful joy of the Brahmin
	woman’s hope, who trusts by some
	fresh incantation to secure a blessing,
	formerly vouchsafed her by the gods,
	but which now old-time petitions fail
	to renew. It seemed cold-blooded, the
	entire arrangement, and yet I knew it
	was not. She was far braver than I
	could have been, even to win her caring.
	But I understood.</p>

	<p>I must have been rough as I took
	her hand. “Look here,” I said. “It’s
	a desperate game, Natica. You
	wouldn’t have dared to say that to any
	other man than me. You’ve got used
	to seeing me fag for you. And I’m going
	to do it this time, too. But if you
	weaken, by Heaven, you’ll deserve to
	lose for good. It’s crazy, it’s the act
	of a pair of paretics, but I’m going to
	see it through.”</p>

	<p>She was crying when I left her.
	“Percy, my dear,” she said; then she began
	to laugh—that after dinner benedictine
	laugh of hers. “If there weren’t
	Jack, that speech of yours just now
	might make me want to kiss you.”</p>

	<p>On the sidewalk I tried to figure out
	if there had been knockout drops in the
	coffee Natica had brewed for me. In
	any one of the forty-eight hours ensuing,
	I might have rung up the Draytons’
	on the telephone, and told her that
	I had come to my senses. But I didn’t
	do anything of the sort. Instead, I
	hunted up a newspaper chap I knew,
	and he put me next to “Boiler-plate”
	Hartopp at the Metropole.</p>

	<p>The bruiser wasn’t as bad sort as I
	had fancied him. He was an Englishman
	all right—a cut below middle class;
	you could tell that by the way he
	clipped his initial h’s off and on. I
	tried the ice at first—it’s always best
	when you don’t know the exact thickness
	of your frozen water. The way I
	tried it was to toss a flower or two at
	Maisie Hartopp and her “Jo-Jo” song.</p>

	<p>He rose sure enough, and it didn’t
	take me a quarter hour to see that the
	pug was really bowled out by the parcel
	of stage skirts who wore his name
	on the Gaiety bills. This made it a
	warmer game than it might have been
	otherwise, but I was in for it now, and
	I made the date.</p>

	<p>No, I didn’t mention Natica. Even
	a broken-to-harness shawl carrier has a
	shred of cautious decency about him.
	But I gabbled lightly about a certain
	feminine party who was keen on exemplars
	of the genuine thing in the line
	of the manly art. Whereupon “Boilerplate”
	acquired a pouter-pigeon chest,
	which fairly bulged over the bar railing,
	and gave me his word of honor
	he’d be waiting at Forty-fourth Street
	about eleven on Friday. He intimated,
	ere I left, that he’d bring his festive accouterments
	with him. And he did.</p>

	<p>We were a bit late—Natica and I. It
	must have been a quarter past the hour
	when we drove up to Cherry’s. I felt
	reasonably certain that if Jack Drayton
	were guarding a champagne bucket
	by the corner table that night, he was
	located then. In the offing, miserably
	self-conscious, a crush hat on the back
	of his really fine head, and two or three
	small locomotive headlights glinting
	from his broad expanse of evening
	shirt, was “Boiler-plate” Hartopp. The
	flunkeys were regarding him curiously,
	and once a waiter-captain came out and
	gave him what seemed to be an unsatisfactory
	report.</p>

	<p>I think the man was just about to
	take the count from sheer nerves, when
	he made me out in the doorway. Natica
	winked—actually winked at me—as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"> </a>he floundered over his share of the
	introduction. Looking at her, and
	faintly divining her mood that night, I
	felt sorry for Jack, for “Boiler-plate”
	and for myself. I left them for a moment
	and went in to see about my table.
	Two minutes later I emerged, to face
	Drayton and the Hartopp unloading
	from an electric hansom. The under-toned
	remark of one of the footman
	came to me: “A bit behind schedule
	time to-night, eh, Charley?”</p>

	<p>There wasn’t anything to do then,
	for they were fair inside. “Boiler-plate”
	was finishing some elephantine
	pleasantry to Natica, when he saw what
	I saw. A foolish grin rippled across
	his wide face. “Hullo!” he said to the
	Hartopp, who looked properly peevish,
	and then waspish, as she let her glance
	travel to Natica, who stood perfectly
	poised and, I fancied, a trifle expectant.
	Drayton eyed them together and in particular.
	The color streaked his forehead
	and faded out. Then he saw me,
	and, although he never may have murder
	in his eyes again, it was there at that
	choice moment. We weren’t at all
	spectacular, you mustn’t think that. It
	was all very quick, and there were a
	lot of people coming and going.</p>

	<p>She was in instant command of the
	situation. Why shouldn’t she have
	been, having created it? And unexpectedly,
	suddenly as she had encountered
	her quarry, equally suddenly she
	shifted her position, without the time to
	take me into her confidence.</p>

	<p>“Don’t bother about our table,
	Percy,” she said. “Now that we’ve met
	friends, it will be jollier to dine <em>en
	famille</em>. It will be ever so much nicer
	than eating in a stuffy restaurant, and
	the butler won’t have gone to bed yet.
	Run out and get us a theater wagon.”</p>

	<p>I went out to the carriage man in
	a trance. The gods, of a deed, were
	fighting furiously on Natica’s side—for
	she could not have foreseen this vantage,
	readily as she swung her attack
	by its aid. Exquisite torture, truly, to
	flaunt a husband’s folly in his own face,
	over his own mahogany, with the source
	of that folly looking on. Drayton’s
	bounden civility to his wife, and to the
	other woman, must make him present
	himself as a target. He knew it, his
	wife knew it; as yet the other woman
	but dimly suspected it—not being over
	subtle—and it smote me in the face
	continuously. The puppet always feels
	the most cut up at times like these. In
	a way, it is because his vanity is being
	seared. Mine fairly crackled.</p>

	<p>So we rattled off up the avenue. The
	only comfortable ones among us were
	Natica and Hartopp. He seemed to
	think the occurrence a pleasant bit of
	chance, and he wasn’t in the least jealous,
	not he. I suppose the wife had him
	schooled to her stage ways of doing
	things.</p>

	<p>Once he turned to Jack with a
	chuckle and said: “This is a jossy bit
	of luck, ain’t it, each of us out with
	the other man’s better?”</p>

	<p>Natica laughed shamelessly. “You’ve
	such a keen appreciation of the ridiculous,
	Mr. Hartopp,” she said. And
	when “Boiler-plate” tried to deny the
	insinuation, his wife nudged him on the
	arm and whispered: “Shut up, Jim.”</p>

	<p>There isn’t any use in stringing out
	the amateur theatricals the five of us
	indulged in that night. The Drayton
	servants were too well chosen to show
	any surprise at being told to put on a
	champagne supper at midnight, and
	then go to bed before it was served.
	We sat at that mahogany table until
	the candelabra were guttering, and each
	of us had toyed more than he ought to
	have done with his glass. Natica acted
	as if she were entertaining in earnest,
	and for the time being I actually think
	she felt that she was. She got the Hartopp
	to sing her “Jo-Jo” song, and the
	Hartopp actually did it as if she enjoyed
	it. Afterward Natica induced
	“Boiler-plate” to tell about the time he
	mixed it up with Fitzsimmons for ten
	rounds.</p>

	<p>“It was a lucky punch that put me
	out,” he kept repeating, almost pathetically.
	“You know Fitz’s lucky punch.”</p>

	<p>I might have seen what was in the
	wind if I hadn’t been thick-headed,
	what with the champagne and the rattles.
	“Boiler-plate” once started on the
	ring, it was an easy transition.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"> </a>“You’ve boxing gloves, haven’t you,
	Jack?” asked Natica. “Get them for
	Mr. Hartopp. Let’s see him demonstrate
	Mr. Fitzsimmons’ lucky punch.”</p>

	<p>Drayton turned without a word, and
	made as if to go upstairs. At the door
	he turned. “Come on, Hartopp,” he
	said. “I’ll lend you a rowing jersey.”</p>

	<p>“You clear a place in the drawing
	room, Percy,” said Natica, briskly. “Be
	sure that the shades are drawn. It
	would be awful to be raided by the police.”
	And I obediently piled the gilt
	parlor furniture in corners.</p>

	<p>The Hartopp fluttered anxiously
	around Natica the while. She was a
	woman, and she was beginning to half
	understand. “Please,” she said, touching
	Natica’s arm. “Jim’s been drinking,
	and he’s very rough when he’s
	been drinking. We’ve all been foolish,
	but only foolish, remember. Jim and I
	sail for London next week. Just let us
	slip away now, and forget all about it.”</p>

	<p>Natica laughed. Her eyes were on
	the door. “Remember, we’ve only been
	foolish,” repeated the Hartopp. “Only
	foolish, that’s all.” She went to Natica
	and shook her arm roughly; there were
	feet upon the stairs. “You silly,” she
	snapped. “You ought to be glad you’re
	married to a gentleman. He’s different
	from all the others. I can tell you that,
	and I know. And I tell you that Jim’s
	been drinking. Jack will——”</p>

	<p>Natica’s pose stiffened, but she did
	not look around. “Yes, <em>Jack</em> will
	what?” she said, coldly.</p>

	<p>The Hartopp flushed. “He’ll be
	hurt,” she finished, weakly. Then, as
	the two from upstairs entered, she whispered:
	“He’ll be hurt worse than you
	are now.”</p>

	<p>The “Boiler-plate” looked very foolish
	in an old Yale rowing shirt, with the
	“Y” stretched taut across his ponderous
	chest. He had a pair of arms like
	a blacksmith. Jack Drayton had taken
	off his coat and was in his shirt sleeves.
	He never looked at Natica, nor at the
	Hartopp; but he tossed me a stopwatch
	and told me to keep time.</p>

	<p>“We’ll box five rounds, Percy,” he
	said.</p>

	<p>Natica clapped her hands. “What
	fun!” she cried. “Jack, you’re boxing
	against my champion.”</p>

	<p>The “Boiler-plate,” who had been regarding
	the work at hand with much
	gravity, again allowed his countenance
	to be relaxed by the old, foolish grin.
	“Oh, I say,” he interposed. “That’s all
	right, but so long as Maisie is in the
	room I’m fighting for her—she’s my
	wife, you know.”</p>

	<p>The Hartopp went to Natica with a
	softened gleam in her eyes; “I saw a
	telephone in the hall,” she said. “I’m
	going out to call a cab.” I heard her
	at the lever as they began to spar.</p>

	<p>I don’t believe I could get a job at
	timekeeping in a real mill. My rounds
	must have been wonderfully and fearfully
	made. For I forgot all about the
	stop-watch now and then, while I
	learned the truth of the Hartopp’s caution
	that “Boiler-plate” grew rough after
	he’d been drinking a bit.</p>

	<p>I knew that Jack had been a pretty
	fair boxer at the university, but, after I
	had called time for the first round, the
	thing was to all intents and purposes a
	genuine fight, and he was all in several
	times over. The “Boiler-plate’s” fists
	made a noise like a woodchopper. Natica
	stood watching it with a queer,
	queer smile. But I saw—and I saw it
	with a sinking at the heart, for I realized
	that I’d cherished the guilty hope
	that things were not really going to be
	straightened out—that with every mark
	of the “Boiler-plate’s” glove, her husband
	was coming back into his own.</p>

	<p>She half sprang toward them when
	Jack went down with a crash, after I
	had got them started on the last go.
	Drayton arose warily, the blood spurting
	from a nasty cut over the eye,
	where the heel of the other’s glove had
	scraped. The “Boiler-plate” lumbered
	dangerously near just then, and Natica,
	despite her, uttered a cry of warning.</p>

	<p>I saw Jack turn away from the mountain
	in the Yale rowing shirt, and his
	eyes met Natica’s squarely for the first
	time since Cherry’s. Something he
	read in them made him laugh. This
	was only for the fraction of a second,
	however, for a glove, with the <em>n</em>th
	power behind it, lifted him a clear
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"> </a>three feet into a stack of gilt chairs near
	his own corner.</p>

	<p>He didn’t move, and the “Boilerplate”
	stared at him stupidly.</p>

	<p>“Say, <em>you</em> made him look at you,” he
	said to Natica. “I didn’t mean to land
	on him blind.”</p>

	<p>But she did not heed him. She was
	among the gilt chairs, with Jack Drayton’s
	head upon her lap. The wheels
	of a cab stopped outside, and the Hartopp
	was seizing her dazed lord and
	master. She had his coat and bediamonded
	linen in her hands, and she
	clutched the “Boiler-plate” firmly, leading
	him to the door.</p>

	<p>“Say, Maisie, wait a minute,” he protested.
	“I’ve got the swell’s college
	shirt on, and I didn’t mean to land on
	him blind.”</p>

	<p>I opened the door, for she signaled
	with her eyes. “Come on, Jim, there’s
	a dear,” she said. Between us we cajoled
	him into the coupe. As I shut the
	door, she leaned to me and whispered:
	“Tell her for me she’s a cat—a cruel
	cat.”</p>

	<p>I handed the driver a bill. “You’ve
	a very bad memory, cabby, haven’t
	you?” I asked.</p>

	<p>“Extremely bad, sir,” said he, touching
	his hat.</p>

	<p>“But, Maisie, I’ve got the swell’s college
	shirt on,” I heard “Boiler-plate” insist.
	Then the wheels moved.</p>

	<p>The Draytons were both upon their
	feet when I stole back into the hall.
	I needed my hat and coat, or I shouldn’t
	have set foot within the house again
	that night. Jack, a bit staggery and
	holding to the back of a chair, mopped
	the cut on his temple with a handkerchief,
	his wife’s handkerchief, in his
	free hand. Natica, a smear of red on
	the front of her frock, stood beside him,
	with a strangely happy expression in
	her face and pose. A great many things
	had been pushed over the precipice
	which leads to forgetfulness, in the time
	I had been out on the sidewalk busy
	with the cabby.</p>

	<p>“Good-night, Percy,” Jack called out.</p>

	<p>“Good-night,” said I, going to him
	to take his hand, for he was too wobbly
	to have met me halfway.</p>

	<p>“It’s been a nightmare,” said he.
	“We’ll wake up to-morrow morning
	and know that we’ve only been asleep.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” I agreed, but looking at the
	puffiness in his face, I thought this was
	coming it a bit strong.</p>

	<p>“Good-night, Percy,” said Natica.
	And gently as she spoke the words, it
	came to me with a sudden rush of conviction
	that I had ceased fagging for
	the Drayton establishment for good—now.</p>

	<p>“It was coming to me,” said Jack. I
	was fiddling on the threshold uncertainly.</p>

	<p>“Hush, you foolish boy,” whispered
	Natica, touching the cut on his forehead,
	just once, with a very tender finger.</p>

	<p>“Yes, it was coming to you,” said
	I. I was glad that they perceived the
	conviction in my speech.</p>

	<p>And that is how I had my last supper
	with Natica.</p>

	the aspect of the white
	brick mansion to indicate
	that a tragedy was
	going on inside. A
	woman quietly dressed,
	her face showing delicately
	above her dark furs, came lightly
	down the steps. She paused a half
	second at the gateway and looked back,
	but there was no hesitation in the
	glance.</p>

	<p>“Jules,” she said to the coachman,
	“you may drive to the park.”</p>

	<p>She did not look back as they drove
	away.</p>

	<p>There should be no gossiping among
	the servants. Everything should be
	done decently. From the park she
	could take the suburban and go quietly
	into town. From there—the world was
	wide. There was a note on his dresser,
	he would read it to-night and understand—no,
	not understand, she had
	ceased to expect that of him—but he
	would know—in some dull, stern way
	he would see—he would see. She
	caught sight of her face in the little
	mirror of the brougham and lowered
	her veil. Ah, it was a bitter, barren
	thing, this striving, striving, endlessly
	striving to be understood. She had
	endured it for four years and she was
	worn heartsick with the strain. Her
	soul cried out for warmth, for life, for
	breathing room; was not one’s first
	duty to one’s self after all? She turned
	suddenly—Jules stood by the open door.</p>

	<p>“Jules,” she said, summoning a little
	severity of manner to counterbalance
	the tremor in her voice, “you need not
	come back for me. Jules,” she added,
	turning again, “good-by—you have—you
	have been very faithful.”</p>

	<p>The man touched his hat gravely and
	stood like a sentinel till she had passed
	from sight among the trees.</p>

	<p>It was late in November, and the
	maple boughs were a riot of red and
	gold. The sky beyond them looked pale
	and far away, as though a white veil
	had been drawn across its tender southern
	blue. She rejoiced now that she
	had elected to spend this last hour in the
	frosty outdoor gladness. With a little
	impulse of relief, she flung back her
	veil and drew a deep breath. Then
	she locked her hands inside her muff
	and began to walk briskly.</p>

	<p>At the park’s further end there was
	a bench, inside a sort of roofless summerhouse,
	where on warm days the
	fountain played in a rainbow. She knew
	the place well—she had sat there many
	times—with him and with another—-she
	would go there now and think her
	own thoughts. It was hidden from the
	driveways, and the place was sweet
	with memories which need not goad and
	pain her. She remembered the last time
	she had sat there. It came back to her
	now with a sudden vividness. It was
	the day she had refused—the other one.
	She remembered the dress she wore—a
	thin little mull, cut low about the throat
	and strewn with pink rosebuds. And it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"> </a>was on that same bench. She had done
	it very gently. She had simply shown
	him her ring, and begged him with a
	little catch of the breath to be her
	friend—always. His was the sort of
	heart a woman might warm herself by
	all her life. He was tender and impulsive
	like herself, and he had always
	understood—always. How could she
	have forgotten for so long? Friends
	were rare—and he had promised to be
	her friend through everything. Her
	friend! Had he realized how much
	that meant?</p>

	<p>Her step had grown very slow; she
	quickened it, lifting her head, and
	reached the little plaza near the fountain,
	her face flushed with the walk, the
	dark tendrils of her hair fallen from
	beneath her floating veil.</p>

	<p>It was very sad here now, and very
	lonely. She had not thought that any
	place long familiar could look so
	strange. She paused, almost dreading
	to enter the old retreat, clothed as it
	was in the withered vine robes of dead
	springs. It was so like the rainbow
	fountain of her own years, checked
	and desolate and still. A whirlwind of
	red and yellow leaves swept about her
	feet. She started nervously, and, opening
	the little gate, went in.</p>

	<p>But the place was not deserted. A
	man sat on the bench. He rose as she
	closed the gate, and when she would
	have withdrawn, he came toward her
	and held out a hand.</p>

	<p>“Oh,” she said, feeling as if she were
	speaking in a dream, “is it—where did
	you come from?”</p>

	<p>“It seems very natural to see you
	here,” he said.</p>

	<p>His face was bronzed and he had
	more beard than formerly, but his eyes
	were the same when he smiled.</p>

	<p>“I did not dream you were anywhere
	near us,” she went on, the wonder deepening
	in her eyes. “I was—you seem
	part of my thoughts—I was thinking of
	you only a moment ago.”</p>

	<p>“You were always kind,” said the
	man. “Let me spread my overcoat on
	the bench—the stone is cold. You have
	been walking, haven’t you?”</p>

	<p>“Yes. I don’t walk much—it tires
	me easily.” She sat down, loosening
	the furs at her throat, Breathing quickly;
	her eyes searched his face, half
	dazed, half questioning. “But where
	have you been?” she asked. “Were you
	not in Africa?”</p>

	<p>“Yes. I have been home only a few
	days—I don’t wonder you are surprised
	finding me here; people don’t often sit
	in the park at this time—but I find it
	cozier than the station across the way.
	I came out on the hill early this noon to
	look up old friends, and I found I’d an
	hour to wait.”</p>

	<p>“Am I not an old friend?” she asked.
	“Why have you not been to see—us?”</p>

	<p>“I hope I may count you such,” said
	the man. “I knew your husband, too,
	many years ago; but he said that you
	were ill; I saw him this morning.”</p>

	<p>“I have been ill,” she answered,
	quickly, and looked away, pushing back
	her hair with the little movement he
	knew so well.</p>

	<p>“I am sorry for that,” he said. “I
	heard of your loss—I did not lose sight
	entirely of my friends. Your little
	boy,” he added, his voice softening—“your
	little boy——”</p>

	<p>“My baby died,” she said.</p>

	<p>“I know—I heard of it—I knew how
	keenly you could suffer. But I knew,
	too, how brave you were——”</p>

	<p>“Oh!” she said, catching the lace at
	her throat. “If he—if my baby had
	lived—I might—I could——”</p>

	<p>She checked herself with a sudden
	biting of the lip, but the tears broke
	from her eyelids and she bowed her
	face.</p>

	<p>“Ah,” said the man, “I know—this is
	very hard; but it is something, after all,
	to have felt—to have known. No loss
	can be so bitter as a lack—a need.”</p>

	<p>There was a moment’s silence between
	them.</p>

	<p>“Tell me of yourself,” she said, quietly,
	at length.</p>

	<p>“There is little to tell. My life is
	very much the same. I have neither
	wife nor child. Until a man finds those,
	he’s a most indifferent topic.”</p>

	<p>“You have never married?” she
	asked.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"> </a>“No. Your life is, fuller, sweeter,
	better. Tell me of that. I used to
	know your husband—did you know?”</p>

	<p>“No,” she said, “I did not know.”</p>

	<p>“Yes, we were chaps together, he and
	I, the same age, though he seemed older—he
	was a plucky little fellow—you
	did not know him long, I believe, before
	you married.”</p>

	<p>She was looking straight before her
	at the still fountain. “No,” she said,
	“I did not know him long.”</p>

	<p>“Ah,” mused the man, “I know him
	well. He is a prince—one of God’s
	own. Somewhat quiet now, I find, but
	he was always rather reserved, his life
	made him so; he was such a kid when
	he began to support them all—the
	mother and the girls, you know. But he
	worked along, going to night school—always
	ready, always courageous. My
	father used to say he’d give all his four
	boys for that one. We never worked
	much, you know. I suppose those who
	don’t know him call him stern, but he
	has carried a pretty heavy load all his
	life, and that sobers a man and takes
	the spring out of him—of course you
	know, though.”</p>

	<p>But the woman said nothing. The
	man paused, regarding her a moment,
	then he let his gaze follow hers.</p>

	<p>“I was thinking of the fountain,” she
	said; “how it once flashed and sang
	and played—and now——”</p>

	<p>“And now,” said the man, “it is silent
	and cold—but the bright water is there
	still, and when the spring comes back
	it will leap forth again. It reminds me
	of my friend of whom we were just
	speaking—your husband. All the glow
	and life are still in his heart, and you
	will waken them. I said when you were
	married, that he needed just that—a
	union with a rich, sunny nature like
	your own, to teach him all that he had
	missed, and give back to him all that he
	had lost.”</p>

	<p>Her, lashes fell slowly, and she
	stroked her muff with one white hand.</p>

	<p>The man spoke on, musingly. “I suppose
	even you do not realize the good
	he does—the help he gives to others.
	He doesn’t talk of himself—he never
	did—even to you, I suppose? No? It
	is like him, he was always so. It was—it
	was in the cemetery I saw him this
	morning. I—when I come home—I always
	go there—my mother is there, you
	remember—I found him by—by your
	little boy. He was talking, with the sexton
	when I came up. It seems the grass
	didn’t grow about the little fellow’s—bed.
	The man admitted that his own
	little folks were accustomed to play
	there—the lot is shady and close to the
	house—they bring their toys and frolic
	there till the grass is quite worn away.
	You should have seen his face when
	the man told him that. ‘Let them come,’
	he said; ‘don’t stop them; the grass
	doesn’t matter.’ ‘The boy won’t be so
	lonely,’ said he to me. ‘It seems so far
	away out here—and he all by himself—he
	was such a little chap—I sort of feel
	one of us ought to stay with him—at
	night.’”</p>

	<p>The woman raised her eyes to his
	face. “Ah,” she said, softly, “did he—did
	he say that?”</p>

	<p>“Yes—and it goes to show, what you
	doubtless know better than I, how deep
	and true and tender he is beneath it all.
	Shan’t I lay this coat more about you?
	I think the air has grown chillier.”</p>

	<p>“No, thank you,” she said, rising.
	“Yes, it is chillier.”</p>

	<p>The man rose also. She stood a moment—her
	hand on the little gate, her
	eyes grown dark and deep. He waited
	at her side.</p>

	<p>Her fingers sought the latch absently.</p>

	<p>“Let me open it for you,” he said.
	“Were you going into town, or did you
	come for the walk?”</p>

	<p>“I?” she said. “Oh, I told Jules not
	to come back for me—it’s a short walk
	home.” She smiled up at him for the
	first time with her old-time brightness.
	“And you,” she said, “you haven’t completed
	the round of your ‘old friends’
	yet—you will come with me.”</p>

	<div class="leftcol" style="height:660px;">
		<img class="illocap" src="images/cap13.png" width="121" height="118" alt="T" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">That</span> his wife was
		keeping something
		from him had
		been unpleasantly
		apparent to Robert
		Penn for over
		two months; but
		what really wore upon his easily
		disturbed nerves was the equally
		obvious fact that her secret was
		the source of an unusual, unnatural,
		unseemly happiness, which she
		took no pains to disguise.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rightcol">
		<p>Robert was the very much overworked
		junior partner in the prosperous
		law firm of Messrs. Flagg,
		Bentnor &amp; Penn; and the question
		of his taking a much-needed rest
		had been gravely discussed by the
		other two partners more than once
		during the year; but the mere suggestion
		of it put him into such a
		tantrum that they let it drop, trusting
		to a redistribution of the work
		of the office to lighten somewhat
		Penn’s burden. So all the fashionable
		<ins id="corr7" class="corr" title="divorçees">divorcées</ins>—hitherto Bentnor’s
		specialty—were turned over to the
		junior partner, as a slight means
		of professional diversion.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

	<p>But he threw himself into the
	cases of his clients, male and female,
	with the same old unsparing
	fervor, and Flagg and Bentnor—the
	latter was Penn’s brother-in-law—raised
	their eyebrows and
	shook their heads behind his back.</p>

	<p>What first drew Robert’s attention
	to his wife’s secret was the
	sudden inexplicable condoning of
	his own small negligences and ignorances,
	which had once been
	brought to book. So accustomed
	does the happily married husband
	of the day become to certain domestic
	requisitions that the withdrawal
	of them is apt to arouse his
	suspicions at once.</p>

	<p>These jealous doubts, later on,
	ran the whole gamut from the
	postman to the rector of Mrs.
	Penn’s church, but at first all Robert
	feared was that she had become
	indifferent to him. That, after five
	happy years, she should be sweetly
	serene when he suddenly remembered
	that he had bought tickets
	for the theater, just as they had
	settled down after dinner for a
	quiet evening, Mrs. Penn looking
	prettily domestic in a lilac tea
	gown! Nothing but the established
	repugnance of a self-made man to
	wasting four dollars, even to save
	his pride, made him uncover his
	delinquency—and he held his
	breath till the storm should pass.
	But no storm followed his confession.
	Instead of which, she sprang
	to her feet, laughing:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"> </a>“Oh, I’m wild to see that play! It
	has a deep, ethical purpose. Can you
	give me six minutes to scratch off this
	gown and bundle myself into another?”</p>

	<p>It was so unusual, and she made such
	a delightful picture standing in the
	doorway, that he felt that the occasion
	deserved recognition.</p>

	<p>“You may have twelve minutes to
	dress in, Helen. I’ll call a cab.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, Rob, how lovely!” and off she
	flew.</p>

	<p>After a moment spent in the happy
	digestion of this delightful antenuptial
	way of exculpating a really outrageous
	masculine default, it slowly dawned
	upon him, as he arose and emptied the
	ash tray into the library fire, that it
	was most unusual, extraordinary, startling!
	There was a time when she
	would have made a scene, and either
	they would have spent the evening
	apart at home in silence, or together at
	the theater in a still more painful silence.</p>

	<p>At that instant was born in Robert
	Penn’s already overwrought brain the
	thought that his wife no longer loved
	him!</p>

	<p>Robert loathed all theatergoing. The
	mere physical restraint was torture to
	so active, high-strung a man, but when
	it came to a problem play—— He not
	unnaturally considered that it represented
	the full measure of his devotion
	to his wife, to spend an evening beside
	her listening to the same old jumble of
	human motives, human passions, that
	had occupied him all day long. Hate,
	jealousy, revenge, greed, infidelity were
	the staples of his trade, as it were; the
	untangling of law, if not always equity,
	from the seething mass was his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
	d’être</em>, and moreover paid his coal bills.
	That Helen was almost morbidly fond
	of the theater had long been his heaviest
	cross.</p>

	<p>His thin, dark face looked very worn
	as he hunched himself into his overcoat
	in the hall, and, looking up, saw Helen
	running down the stairs, just as she
	used to do in the dear old sweetheart
	days, chattering merrily the while:</p>

	<p>“Talk of Protean artists! Vaudeville
	clamor for me some day—you’ll
	see! I’ll be five characters in twenty-five
	minutes, and no one of them Helen
	Penn!”</p>

	<p>And then she looked so altogether exactly
	the way he liked his wife to look,
	that he whispered something quite absurdly
	lover-like to her as he put her
	into the cab. She laughed in an excited,
	detached way and made no response
	in kind, and again his mood
	changed and a chilly fog of vague suspicion
	closed in upon him.</p>

	<p>At the theater he leaned back in his
	seat and watched Helen with eyes that
	began to reinventory her personality,
	seeking to comprehend this strange exhilaration
	that had recently uplifted her
	out of all her environment.</p>

	<p>Once, between the second and third
	acts, Helen asked Robert for a pencil
	and made a note on the margin of her
	program, which she laughingly refused
	to let him read. It was all that was
	needed to crystallize his resentment,
	and muttering something about “a
	whiff of tobacco,” he got up and went
	to the lobby.</p>

	<p>It so happened that Mr. Flagg, the
	dignified senior member of their successful
	firm, was strolling about alone
	with a cigarette, and after greetings
	between the two Flagg said, in a low
	tone, to Robert:</p>

	<p>“It’s all up with your side of the
	Perry case! The evidence in rebuttal
	will knock you higher than Haman.
	I’ve just got hold of it—I’ll explain in
	the morning. It seems that your pretty
	client has been hoodwinking <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">caro sposo</em>
	for two years—all the time looking like
	a Botticello angel, all pure soul and
	sublimated thought, dressed always in
	shades of gray—pearl gray, Penn!”
	laughed Flagg; “a dove with the heart
	of a—— There’s the bell! Come down
	early to-morrow, there’s work ahead for
	us all.”</p>

	<p>The first thing that Robert did as he
	sank into his seat was to note the shade
	of Helen’s gown—it was a dull lead
	color!</p>

	<p>If jealousy is once allowed so much
	as a finger tip within the portals of a
	heart, the chances are that within an
	inconceivably short time he will be in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"> </a>entire possession, sprawled all over the
	place, yelling for corroboration and
	drinking it thirstily until madness
	comes.</p>

	<p>Every little unrelated incident in
	Robert’s home life fell suddenly into
	place under suspicion’s nimble fingers.
	Up to that time he had been reasonably
	sure of the integrity of his hearthstone.
	Only within those eight weeks had
	these new symptoms been developing in
	the conduct of the wife of his bosom,
	the mother of his little daughter, Betty.
	Her curiously happy exaltation, her absentmindedness,
	her long, smiling reveries;
	the look of flushed excitement on
	her pretty face, the odd impression of
	breathlessness; the muttering of strange
	words in her sleep, followed by bursts
	of almost ribald laughter. Could it be
	possible that she was leading a double
	life, like that other woman?—-a life to
	which he had no latchkey?</p>

	<p>What was that devilish thing in “The
	Cross of Berny”—from Gautier’s pen,
	if he remembered rightly, among those
	four royal collaborateurs—“To call a
	woman—my wife! What revolting indiscretion!
	To call children——” But
	the thought of little Betty hushed even
	his mad imaginings.</p>

	<p>However, it was his business to fathom
	all this mystery at once. An idealist
	was a blind ass—look at Perry!</p>

	<p>Penn did not rest well that first night
	after the problem play, nor for many
	nights to come.</p>

	<p>One morning a question of law came
	up at the office that made it expedient
	that one of the firm should go at once
	to Washington to consult a supreme
	authority, and Robert was sent, that he
	might have the benefit of even that
	small change of scene. He rushed
	home to throw a few things into a bag
	and kiss his wife and Betty good-by.
	He opened the front door with his
	latchkey as usual, and as usual called
	out:</p>

	<p>“Helen, where are you?”</p>

	<p>There was a low cry, the shuffle of
	feet across a hardwood floor, the bang
	of a door closed quickly, and then in a
	voice toned to sudden <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</em> and
	overdoing it:</p>

	<p>“Here I am, Rob, in the library.”</p>

	<p>He stood frozen stiff for an instant,
	as his legal experience whispered to
	him all the possibilities hidden in those
	few sounds. The main thing was to
	keep his head! He went to the library
	and found Helen sitting alone in his
	own especial chair, peacefully reading
	Boswell’s “Life of Johnson,” as he was
	quick to notice as he passed behind her.</p>

	<p>Although her attitude was one of
	rather sleepy repose, there were signs
	of a hasty rearrangement of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise
	en scène</em>, which corroborated the aural
	evidence which reached him in the hall.
	Near the door to the reception room
	was a piece of paper; he slipped on a
	round “Carteret” pencil as he went to
	his desk in a silence that he felt that he
	could not break, without also breaking
	a few other things.</p>

	<p>Helen sat watching him in surprise—not
	an altogether genuine surprise, he
	thought, after one glance—thank
	Heaven, he was an expert in moral turpitudes
	and sinuosities—the woman did
	not live who could deceive him!</p>

	<p>“Did you forget something, Rob?
	Why didn’t you telephone? I could
	have sent it to you,” she asked, simply.
	Ah, that accursed simplicity! Well,
	she would find that he was not simple,
	that was one sure thing.</p>

	<p>“No, Helen, I forgot nothing—I
	never do forget anything,” he said, with
	sullen meaning. “Where’s Betty?”</p>

	<p>“It’s a fair day and it’s eleven; of
	course she is out in the park,” replied
	Helen, smiling.</p>

	<p>He smiled too, but in such a way
	that she sat forward in her chair with
	dilated eyes, into which Robert read a
	rising fear.</p>

	<p>“Dear, what is it? What is wrong?”</p>

	<p>“Wrong? Who said wrong? <em>I</em>
	didn’t,” he found himself saying, greatly
	to his disappointment, for suspicions
	are useless until graduated into—evidence;
	so he hastened to explain his errand;
	sorting over some papers at his
	desk meanwhile. All the time his mind
	was intent upon one thing only—the
	possession of that piece of paper lying
	near the reception-room door.</p>

	<p>He walked toward the cabinet in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"> </a>corner to fill his pockets with cigars;
	the paper was lying just behind him,
	and as he turned he would stoop and
	pick it up.</p>

	<p>He heard a slight noise behind him,
	and, wheeling-swiftly, discovered Helen
	creeping toward the paper, her hand already
	outstretched. With one quick
	movement he snatched it from the floor,
	and forced himself to hold it aloft and
	laugh a little. He might have spared
	himself all that finesse, for she ran to
	him, clinging to his arm, laughing,
	coaxing, pouting, begging him to give
	it to her—unread!</p>

	<p>“Rob, you’ll break my heart if you
	read that. Please not now—later perhaps—some
	day I will explain; please,
	dear!”</p>

	<p>“If the contents of this paper are sufficiently
	serious to break your heart if
	I do read it, perhaps mine will be broken
	if I don’t. So, as a measure of self-preservation——” He
	put the piece of
	note paper into his pocket. His face
	was white, his pulse was galloping like
	mad, and yet he managed a rather
	ghastly smile into her face, upraised
	and pleading.</p>

	<p>“Face of a Botticello angel!” he
	thought, and steeled his heart against
	her.</p>

	<p>She sank into a chair half laughing
	and yet with an introverted expression—“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recueillement
	d’esprit</em>,” he thought
	to himself, bitterly. Brushing her hair
	in passing lightly with his lips, he left
	the room and presently the house.
	When she discovered that he had gone
	without again seeing her, she flew to
	the telephone and held a long incoherent
	talk with some one she not infrequently
	called “Ben, dear,” to whom
	she confided certain undefined fears
	about her husband and her future. A
	suggestion of a trip to Europe from
	the other end of the telephone met with
	her unbounded gratitude and enthusiasm.
	After urging haste, she left the
	colloquy almost her old smiling self,
	and went to the library, where she did
	not continue the reading of Boswell’s
	“Life of Johnson,” but went thence directly
	to the reception room—into
	which Robert had peered before leaving
	the house—and, stooping, she drew
	from under the lounge many sheets of
	paper, and was soon lost in their perusal.</p>

	<p>Robert had been forced to wait until
	he was settled on the train for Washington
	before he found time to read the
	note whose possession had caused Helen
	such perturbation. It was evidently
	the middle page of a letter, a single
	sheet, note size, torn from a pad. The
	handwriting was unquestionably masculine,
	entirely unfamiliar to Penn, hurried
	and full of what Helen would have
	called—temperament.</p>

	<p>After one glance, the blood rushed to
	his head, and his hot eyes devoured
	again and again these words:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Since our interview yesterday, and in regard
		to that irresistible scene of the blue
		stockings, I am not willing to let it drop.</p>

		<p>However, I should like to suggest abbreviation,
		and I fear I shall have to ask you to
		change the shade to a dull bluish gray. If
		you will come to my office in the morning, I
		feel sure we can soon arrange a climax which
		shall embody your own wishes and mine.
		As to the effect—the after-effect—of her husband’s
		death on H. P.’s character, attention
		will be diverted from that by the previous
		gossip about——</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And there it ended.</p>

	<p>The initials, H. P.—Helen Penn—were
	the tacks that fastened conviction
	to Robert’s consciousness; conviction of
	an intrigue of long standing and unspeakable
	familiarities—all these verbal
	obscurities were only too sickeningly
	familiar to him, fresh from the Perry
	letters—but here was more!</p>

	<p>Apparently a coolly plotted murder—one
	ray of light only his eyes clung to—the
	“climax” was yet <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine!</em></p>

	<p>In a well-built city house the insertion
	of a latchkey and opening of a
	front door between ten and eleven
	o’clock at night are noises easily covered
	by the urban roar of even one of
	the lateral streets of a great city. Robert
	entered and closed the door with—he
	assured himself—no greater minimum
	of noise than is instinctive toward
	midnight with even a sober married
	man. Among all the emotions which
	had seethed through his mind during
	the past few hours, a reaction was at
	that moment in possession of him, in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>favor of his wife, who had been to him
	a well of sweet water through all those
	years. If evil was drawing near to her,
	why push her toward it? Surely a finer
	thing would be to warn and protect
	her, to beat down underfoot his own
	wounded <em>ego</em> and win her back!</p>

	<p>The electric light in the hall was
	burning, and he went directly to the
	library. Touching an electric button
	near the door, the room was flooded
	with light, and there before his weary
	eyes, hanging over the back of his
	Morris chair, was—Heaven help him!—a
	pair of long delft-blue silk stockings!
	Robert’s agony was black upon him, his
	mind once more full of crawling, writhing
	suspicions; his mouth and throat
	were parched, his pulse beats filled the
	world.</p>

	<p>Then into the silence fell Helen’s
	laugh from the floor above, a long peal
	of mirth that spoke clearly of companionship.
	He had not made a life study
	of psychic differentiation for nothing—Helen
	was not alone! From that instant,
	all pretenses were abandoned,
	Robert was a sleuthhound on a keen
	scent.</p>

	<p>With his head well forward, he crept
	up the carpeted stairway. The upper
	hall light was burning low; from his
	wife’s “sewing room,” as it was called,
	came the sound of voices. The door
	was ajar, and from the crevice a strong
	light flooded out into the twilight of the
	hall. Now entirely mad with jealousy,
	he softly glided toward the crack, but
	before his eyes could further feed his
	torture, his ears served up a plenitude,
	in Helen’s voice—that dear, clear, sweet
	voice that had sung his child to sleep
	and——</p>

	<p>“Mr. Stillingfleet—my dear Mr. Stillingfleet,
	if I may be allowed the liberty——”</p>

	<p>“My dearest creature,” interrupted a
	deep voice, muffled, almost as if by intent
	disguised, “if it be a liberty to call
	me dear, I find myself craving the instant
	fall of kingdoms.”</p>

	<p>“La, sir, you confuse me quite!”
	There was a rustle of silken skirts and
	Helen laughed again.</p>

	<p>Peering cautiously in, this sight met
	Robert’s bloodshot eyes: Helen—or at
	least the fantastic figure which had her
	voice—stood by the mantelpiece. The
	hair was high-rolled and powdered, in
	it two nodding white plumes; she wore
	a yellow brocade gown strangely cut,
	long black mitts on her hands, which
	waved a huge fan coquettishly at a man—a
	creature in the costume of Goldsmith’s
	day—who stood near her, bowing
	low. On his head was a wig, powdered
	and in queue, his face a mask of
	paint and powder and patches. He was
	clad in a huge waistcoat, long coat,
	knee breeches and hose—<em>blue</em> hose—upon
	his comely legs! Putting out his
	hand toward Helen’s, he said with sickening
	affectation, seizing her hand and
	raising it to his lips:</p>

	<p>“It’s high time we were off to Montague’s,
	my fair H. P. ‘Time flies,
	death urges, knells call, heaven invites!’”</p>

	<p>For an instant a very ancient and
	honorable desire to enter that room
	and violently change the face of several
	things dominated the listening husband;
	that he did not marked the high tide
	of his nervous breakdown. A sudden
	reaction, common to the neurasthenic,
	swept over him, and his soul withdrew
	in anguish from the sickening horror
	of the discovery. He crept softly down
	the stairs, seized hat and coat and staggered
	out into the night.</p>

	<p>It was five days before Benjamin
	Bentnor’s best detective work succeeded
	in finding his brother-in-law in a
	hall bedroom at an obscure hotel in
	Washington, for a strong impulse of
	duty to be performed had landed Robert
	there, although he had completely
	lost sight of his mission. When Ben
	found him, he was seated on the edge
	of the bed, his head bowed in his hands.</p>

	<p>Bentnor’s gentleness toward him
	would have shown a saner man that his
	condition was serious; but it took a physician
	to do that in the end, and a year
	of rest and travel to cure him.</p>

	<p>At first, however, all Bentnor could
	do was to sit about rather helplessly
	and chatter in an effort to break
	through Robert’s gloom. The second
	day after he found his brother-in-law,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>he was at his wits’ end to find further
	subjects for cheerful conversation, until
	toward evening he had a sudden inspiration!</p>

	<p>To be sure it was Helen’s secret, but
	surely she would not object to anything
	which might serve to arouse her poor
	husband’s interest, however slightly,
	and bring him to the point of consenting
	to return to his home.</p>

	<p>Bentnor was short, stout, slightly
	bald, and somehow radiated comfort,
	even while sitting astride of a cane-bottomed
	chair, and smoking another
	man’s brand of cigarettes, in a one-windowed
	room nine feet by ten and a
	half.</p>

	<p>“Helen Bentnor Penn’s a great girl,
	isn’t she, Rob?” No response came
	from the huddled figure on the bed.</p>

	<p>“Of course, all the Bentnors have
	brains—you must have observed that
	for yourself; but she’s the first literary
	genius among us, although I’ve always
	felt that all I needed was leisure—however,
	that’s neither here nor there. Helen
	has arrived, and shall have the
	honor. Why, the editor who accepted
	that clever little <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lever de rideau</em> of hers
	and brings it out in this month’s issue
	of his magazine, was downright enthusiastic—can
	you imagine an editor having
	any enthusiasm left in him, Penn?
	I can’t, for one. Must have a magnificent
	flow of gastric juice! However
	that may be, this chap has taken Helen
	up <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</em>, and written advice as to
	some changes, and given her interviews
	and all that. Most amateurs have to
	have several ‘fittings,’ I suppose. And
	then the check he sent her—by Jove,
	even I was surprised!”</p>

	<p>Robert looked up for the first time,
	and turned a haggard face, blank with
	wonder, toward his wife’s brother. Ben
	laughed.</p>

	<p>“Well, I suppose it is a bit of a
	shock to a man to find that his wife’s
	brains have a market value.” He was
	greatly encouraged by Penn’s aroused
	interest and hurried on with his tale:</p>

	<p>“It strikes me I oughtn’t to be telling
	you this, Rob, for it was Helen’s birthday
	surprise for you. She’s been in an
	ecstasy over it for about eight weeks.
	Don’t you tell her I’ve told you! Promise!”</p>

	<p>“Trust me,” murmured Penn, and
	a smile twitched at his face.</p>

	<p>“Such plottings and plans and secrecy!
	I’ve been in it up to the neck
	from the first. On your birthday—somehow
	she’s in love with you yet,
	Penn—Lord, how does a man do that?—for
	breakfast she was to show you the
	magazine within whose fold is to be
	found her first literary lambkin; for
	luncheon—for you were to spend the
	day at home—she was going to give
	you the check! Generous little beggar,
	Nell! She said she had never been
	able to really give you anything before—she
	had only bought with your money
	and forced upon you things you didn’t
	want. Then that night after dinner she
	and I were to act her two-part play—we’ve
	been at it for weeks, tooth and
	nail, powder and patches——”</p>

	<p>“<em>You</em> and Helen!” gasped Robert.</p>

	<p>“Great Scott! who on earth else?—the
	editor?” laughed Bentnor, little
	dreaming what the few words meant
	to the distraught man before him. “Perhaps
	you think I can’t do that sort of
	thing! It’s in our blood, the love of the
	buskin. The fact is, I’ve always had my
	suspicions that in the time of Charles
	the Second—well, never mind. We
	had our last final farewell dress rehearsal
	the night you came on here. I tell
	you I’m great in it. Helen, to be sure,
	does fairly well as <em>Hester Piozzi</em>, but
	wait till you see me as <em>Mr. Stillingfleet</em>!
	You know he was the fellow whose
	grayish-blue stockings gave the name
	for all time to ‘blue-stocking’ clubs.
	He and Dr. Johnson were always buzzing
	around the literary women of that
	day, the pretty D’Arblay, the dignified
	Mistress Montague of Portman Square,
	and the great Piozzi herself—of course,
	you remember?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, I remember,” whispered Robert,
	his face once more hidden, but a
	great peace possessing him. “Ben,” he
	cried, almost joyfully, “what’s the title
	of Helen’s play?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bas Bleu</em>,” said Bentnor, concealing
	his triumph at his own tactics in the
	lighting of his twenty-third cigarette.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>Robert groaned, and his head again
	drooped in unspeakable humiliation.
	And in that moment he made up his
	mind that no one should ever share his
	guilty secret. To make a pathetic appeal
	to Helen, dwelling upon his love,
	his doubts, his torturing jealousy, was
	one thing; quite another to tell that
	hopelessly humorous, refusing-to-be-pathetic
	story of those ridiculous <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas
	bleus</em>—they dangled everywhere from
	every point of his story; flying, pirouetting,
	circling and pin-wheeling in a
	psychic <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul!</em> It was impossible
	for even a member of the firm of Flagg,
	Bentnor &amp; Penn to be impressive. Let
	them call it a nervous breakdown, his
	lips were forever sealed.</p>

	<p>Then the thought of his home came
	to him like distant music. He saw himself
	opening his door; he saw a small
	ball of white coming down the stairs
	backward in a terrifying fury of speed,
	the little, fat, half-bare legs and a swirl
	of tiny skirts all that was visible of his
	wee daughter coming to greet him. He
	saw himself catch her off the last step
	and lift her in his arms, burying his
	face against the baby’s hot, panting little
	body, then he heard Helen’s voice
	and the sound of her scurrying feet!</p>

	<p>Robert sprang up, and with a burst
	of wild laughter, shouted:</p>

	<p>“Ben, let’s go home! I believe you’re
	dead right—I’ve got nervous prostration,
	and I’ve got it bad!”</p>

		<h2>THE DOING OF THE LAMBS</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Susan Sayre Titsworth</p>
	</div>
	<div class="leftcol">
		<img class="illocap" src="images/cap15.png" width="118" height="117" alt="W" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Well</span>, so long,
		fellows,” said
		the Goat, and
		rose to go.</p>

		<p>“Good-night,
		old man,” responded
		the cheerful chorus of
		his hosts. As the Goat went out into
		the hall there was silence in the room
		he had left, which lasted until after he
		had opened the hall door and had had
		time to close it. But instead of closing
		it, he merely bumped noisily against it,
		and rattled the knob, and stood listening.
		As if his departure were a signal,
		a roar of laughter from within followed
		his stratagem. One voice rose above
		the noise.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rightcol">
		<p>“By George!” it said. “Isn’t he the
		limit?”</p>

		<p>The Goat closed the door silently and
		mounted the stairs to his own room in
		the apartment above. His suspicions
		were confirmed.</p>

		<p>They had dragged him in with them
		as they all came over together from
		dinner at the Commons, to tell them
		some more of his wild Western tales. It
		was not the first time they had done
		it. They were a select little group of
		Eastern men, two or three years out
		of Harvard or Yale, in rather good repute
		with the faculty of the Law School
		for the quality of their work, and
		known among their fellow students as
		the Lambs, from their somewhat ostentatious
		habit of flocking together.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

	<p>The Goat was from the West, a graduate
	of a prairie college of Moravian
	foundation, an athletic, good-looking
	young fellow in badly-fitting
	clothes, who appeared in no way
	ashamed to admit that he had
	never before been east of the
	Mississippi, and was frankly impressed
	by New York. His <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucherie</em>
	was not ungraceful; there was an attractive
	impertinence in his cheerful assertions
	that his Moravian grandparents
	had desired him not to smoke or
	drink until he had completed his education
	and was earning his own living,
	and that, consequently, he knew tobacco
	only by sight and smell, and had contented
	himself with looking on the wine
	when it was red. There was one vacant
	seat at the table, which the Lambs
	occupied at the Commons; with an eye
	to future entertainment they had invited
	the Goat to join them, and in the two
	months since the term began, the arrangement
	had given general satisfaction.</p>

	<p>They had undertaken the education
	of the Goat; they set him up to the
	theater, with supper at the Black Cat or
	Pabst’s afterward, and lay awake nights
	howling at the recollection of his naïve
	and shrewd comments; they took him
	walking to show him the historical landmarks
	of New York, extemporizing the
	landmarks and the history as they went
	along, to the delighted gratitude of the
	Goat, who lamented that Arizona had
	no associations. They egged him on to
	tell stories of his prowess with lasso
	and lariat, of which he was boyishly
	proud, and listened with flattering attention
	to his relations of grizzly hunts
	and Greaser raids. He usually told
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>these experiences as happening to a
	friend of his, and blushed and looked
	sheepish when they accused him of
	modesty. In return for the pleasure he
	afforded them, they coached him in first-year
	law, and gave him pointers about
	the professors’ idiosyncrasies, feeling
	well repaid by his enthusiastic reports
	of his good progress, and of the encouraging
	impression he was making on
	his instructors.</p>

	<p>And, finally, they were teaching him
	to smoke. After much urging, he had
	consented to try it, and had accomplished
	part of a cigar. Then he had
	suddenly become silent, looked at it intently
	for a few moments, and then,
	murmuring an indistinct excuse, had
	retired with precipitation. He appeared
	at breakfast the next morning, good-naturedly
	accepted all the chaffing he
	got, and bravely essayed another that
	evening.</p>

	<p>That had been a week or more before.
	On this particular night he had
	successfully smoked a whole Chancellor
	without growing pale or letting it go
	out, treating them meanwhile to a vivacious
	narrative of a drunken gambler
	who had been run out of a little
	mining camp one stormy winter night,
	and had taken refuge with a friend of
	the Goat, also caught out in the blizzard,
	in a cave which proved to be the
	domicile of a big hibernating grizzly
	not thoroughly hibernated; at the close,
	he had, as usual, protested but not
	denied when they politely insisted on
	identifying his friend with himself.
	Then he had torn himself away to study
	common-law pleading in the suspicious
	manner previously described.</p>

	<p>There was, however, no sign of resentment
	or of injured feelings in his
	face as he lit the gas in his own room.
	On the contrary, he grinned cheerfully
	at his reflection in the glass, and, pulling
	open his top drawer, took from the
	remote corner an unmistakably sophisticated
	brier and a package of Yale
	Mixture, and proceeded to light up.
	He grinned again as his teeth clamped
	on the stem, and jerked it into the
	corner of his mouth with a practiced
	twist of his tongue. Then he picked up
	a small and well-thumbed book lying
	half hidden among his law books and
	papers, and glanced over a few pages.</p>

	<p>“I did that pretty well,” he said, approvingly.
	“Pity those babes don’t
	know their Bret Harte any better.
	Guess I’ll ring in some of Teddy’s ’97
	trip on ’em to-morrow night.” And
	then he sat down to study.</p>

	<p>The next day the Lamb from Boston
	announced that his cousin and her
	mother, who were passing through
	town on their way home from three
	years of wandering abroad, were coming
	to call on him at four. Therefore,
	at two, he and his brother Lambs began
	to prepare his room, and the only other
	one that was visible from the front door
	of their apartment, for the fitting reception
	of his relatives. This preparation
	consisted largely in moving all presentable
	articles in all the rooms into
	these two, and banishing all unpresentable
	into the most remote of the other
	rooms, and shutting that door. The
	Lamb from Brookline inspected the pictures
	and photographs, straightening
	the first, retiring some of the second,
	and adding a few of both borrowed
	from the other members of the flock,
	and arranged to suit his own artistic
	fancy; the Lamb from Philadelphia polished
	off the cups and saucers with a
	clean towel; then the Lamb from Boston
	took the towel and dusted the mantel.
	After their labors, they attired
	themselves in their “glad rags,” and
	sat in readiness behind their half-closed
	doors, while the Boston Lamb
	laid out two or three law tomes on his
	couch, and assumed a studious attitude
	in his Morris chair. Promptly at four
	appeared the Cousin and the Aunt.</p>

	<p>They were courteously impressed by
	the Lamb’s bachelor quarters and the
	appurtenances thereof, nor was the significance
	of the “Cases on Quasi-Contracts,”
	which the Lamb ostentatiously
	hustled away, lost upon them. The
	Cousin insisted on looking at it, and her
	comments were of so sprightly a character
	and so difficult to return in kind,
	that the Lamb, conscious of the open
	doors, and not desiring to subject the
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</em> of his friends to a very
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>severe strain, called in his brother
	Lambs to meet his relatives.</p>

	<p>They attended promptly, three personable
	young men in irreproachable afternoon
	dress, overjoyed to find the
	Cousin as pretty as her voice was musical,
	and as entertaining as her skillful
	jolly of the Boston Lamb had led them
	to expect. In ten minutes the flock was
	hers to command. The Philadelphia
	Lamb took down from its new position
	on the Boston Lamb’s wall the cherished
	Whistler of the Brookline Lamb,
	and presented it to her; the Boston
	Lamb begged her acceptance of the
	quaint little Cloisonné cup which she
	admired as she drank from it, and which
	was the property of the Philadelphia
	member; the Albany Lamb, on the plea
	that everything of value had already
	been abstracted from him to make the
	Boston Lamb’s room pretty for her, offered
	her himself, and was in no way
	cast down when she declined him on
	the ground that he was too decorative
	to be truly useful. But in the middle of
	the recrimination that followed this
	turning state’s evidence on the part of
	the Albany Lamb, the Cousin inquired:</p>

	<p>“You are all law students—do any
	of you know a man named Freeman
	who is studying up here?” The flock
	looked at each other and smiled. Freeman
	was the Goat’s name.</p>

	<p>“She doesn’t mean the Goat,” explained
	the Boston Lamb, hastily. “We
	know a first-year man named Freeman,”
	he added, turning to her, “but he’s a
	wild and woolly Westerner, who’d never
	been off the plains of Arizona till he
	came here. There may be others, but
	we’re educating only one.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, no,” said the Cousin. “The Mr.
	Freeman I mean is the son of the consul-general
	to Japan—he’s a San Francisco
	man, and he’s been everywhere.
	We met him first in Cairo, and then we
	played together in Yokohama, and came
	as far as Honolulu together, last spring.
	He decided to study law in New York,
	and I know he lives up here somewhere.”</p>

	<p>“Such a nice young fellow!” contributed
	the Aunt.</p>

	<p>“Don’t know him,” said the flock.</p>

	<p>“We’ll ask the Goat about him,” suggested
	the Philadelphia Lamb.</p>

	<p>“We’ve been so engrossed with our
	own pet Freeman that we haven’t had
	time for any other,” volunteered the
	Brookline Lamb.</p>

	<p>“It’s rather strange,” began the
	Cousin, and then interrupted herself.
	“Anyway, I hope you’ll all look him
	up; I am sure he will be very grateful.”
	The flock acknowledged the bouquet by
	appropriate demonstrations.</p>

	<p>“Our acquaintance with his namesake
	verges on the altruistic, also,” ventured
	the Albany Lamb.</p>

	<p>“I should not like, myself, to be the
	victim of your altruism,” said the
	Cousin, with a slow glance that took
	them all in. In the midst of the delighted
	expostulations that greeted this
	shot, the apartment bell rang sharply.
	The Brookline Lamb, being nearest,
	went to open the door, and, having
	opened it, remarked in a subdued but
	unmistakably sincere manner:</p>

	<p>“Well, I’ll be——” A saving recollection
	of the Cousin and the Aunt
	brought him to a full stop there, but
	everybody looked up, and for a moment
	the flock was speechless. Not so the
	Goat, for it was the Goat who stood
	there, arrayed in the afternoon panoply
	of advanced civilization, with a cigarette
	between his fingers and the neatest
	of sticks under his arm.</p>

	<p>“Beg pardon!” he said. “Didn’t realize—regret
	exceedingly—should never
	have intruded—why, Miss Brewster!”
	And with an instant combination of
	high hat, stick and cigarette that
	showed much practice, he came in to
	shake hands with the Cousin, who, suddenly
	displaying a brilliant color, had
	risen and taken a step toward him.</p>

	<p>“What luck! what bully good luck!”
	he went on. “Mrs. Brewster, how do
	you do? This is like old Cairo days.
	Boston, you brute, why didn’t you mention
	this at luncheon?”</p>

	<p>The flock choked; this was from the
	Goat, who had unobtrusively consumed
	most of the plate of toast at noon while
	the Lambs were discussing the visit of
	the Cousin and the Aunt. The Albany
	Lamb rose to the occasion feebly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>“There seems to have been some mistake,”
	he said. The Goat put his hat
	on the bust of the young Augustus, and
	sat down on the divan beside the
	Cousin.</p>

	<p>“Well, now I’ve happened in,
	mightn’t I have some tea?” he inquired,
	genially. “No lemon, if you please,”
	and he pointed a suggestive finger at
	the rum. In dazed silence the Brookline
	Lamb hastened to serve him, while
	the Cousin said, with a peculiar little
	smile tightening the corners of her
	mouth:</p>

	<p>“I thought it was strange that you
	didn’t know Mr. Freeman.”</p>

	<p>“We really don’t,” said the Boston
	Lamb, making a late recover. “I’m not
	at all sure that he is a fit person for you
	to associate with—all we know of him
	is what he has told us himself.”</p>

	<p>“That’s all right,” said the Goat, impudently.
	“And, anyway, I didn’t come
	to see you this time, old man.”</p>

	<p>“What has he told you?” demanded
	the Cousin, as the Boston Lamb gasped
	with impotent rage.</p>

	<p>“A series of Munchausen adventures,”
	returned the Philadelphia Lamb,
	vindictively. “Six Apaches and three
	and a half Sioux with one throw of the
	lasso.”</p>

	<p>“Won out in a hugging match with a
	ten-foot grizzly,” added the Albany
	Lamb.</p>

	<p>“Nonsense!” said the Cousin, interrupting
	the Brookline Lamb’s sarcasm
	in regard to nerve cures. “Hasn’t he
	told you about the mob at Valladolid?
	Or about San Juan?” The flock gazed
	with unutterable reproach at the Goat,
	who sipped his tea with a critical frown,
	and observed, pleasantly:</p>

	<p>“That happened to a friend of mine.”</p>

	<p>The Lambs surrendered at discretion,
	and roared. The Cousin glanced at the
	Aunt, and they rose.</p>

	<p>“We have had the most attractive
	time,” said the Cousin, prettily, as, suddenly
	sobered by this calamity, the
	Lambs protested in a body against her
	going. “It has been charming—and I
	am so interested in your experiment in
	altruism.” The Lambs collapsed under
	the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</em> nature of the smile
	she bestowed upon them, as she turned
	and held out a frank hand to the Goat.
	“I am glad you happened in,” she said.
	“I mailed a note to you this morning—you
	will doubtless get it to-night. Come
	and see us.”</p>

	<p>“The Holland, isn’t it?” said the
	Goat, holding her hand, and then he
	made a short speech to her that sounded
	to the paralyzed Lambs like a Chinese
	laundry bill, but which evidently carried
	meaning to the Cousin, for she flushed
	and nodded. Then she turned back to
	the flock, who by this time, with touching
	unanimity, were showering devoted
	attentions on the Aunt. At the elevator
	they were all graciously dismissed
	except the Boston Lamb, who alone
	went down to put his relatives into their
	cab.</p>

	<p>“Come and see us, all of you,” called
	the Cousin, cordially, as the car began
	to descend.</p>

	<p>“How soon?” begged the Albany
	Lamb, anxiously.</p>

	<p>“Any time, after to-night,” returned
	the Cousin, and was lowered from their
	sight.</p>

	<p>Then with one accord they fell upon
	the Goat, and bore him into the apartment
	for condign punishment, regardless
	of his indignant assertions of his
	right as a citizen to a trial by a jury
	of his peers. When the Boston Lamb
	came leaping up the stairs to add his
	weight to the balancing of accounts, he
	found a riotous crowd.</p>

	<p>“Just because my luggage was derailed
	and burned up out in the Kansas
	deserts,” the Goat was saying, “and I
	struck New York in a suit of hobo
	clothes from Topeka—oh, you fellows
	are easy marks!”</p>

	<p>“Where are your Moravian grandparents?”
	demanded the Albany Lamb.</p>

	<p>“Don’t know,” said the Goat, unfilially.
	“They died before I was born.
	They weren’t Moravians, anyway.”</p>

	<p>“See here!” The Boston Lamb
	jerked him to his feet with one hand
	and assaulted him with the other.
	“What was that stuff you were reeling
	off to my cousin? As her nearest male
	relative, geographically speaking, I insist
	on an explanation.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>“That was Japanese,” said the Goat,
	with a grin, and immediately favored
	the crowd with several more doubtfully
	emphatic remarks in the same tongue.</p>

	<p>“I pass!” said the Boston Lamb,
	meekly. “But one thing more. Are
	you engaged to my cousin?”</p>

	<p>“How very impertinent!” returned
	the Goat. “Why didn’t you ask her?”</p>

	<p>The Boston Lamb inserted four determined
	fingers between the Goat’s
	collar and the back of his neck, and in
	view of the attitude of mind and body
	of the other Lambs, the Goat saw fit
	to yield.</p>

	<p>“Not exactly, as yet,” he admitted.
	“But to-night—I hope——”</p>

	<p>“After which we are invited to call—oh,
	you brute!” groaned the Albany
	Lamb, and started for him. But the
	Goat had pulled himself loose, and
	gained the door. He stopped, however,
	to pull an oblong package from his coat
	pocket.</p>

	<p>“Here,” he said, tossing it toward the
	crowd. “The smokes are on me tonight.
	Sorry I can’t be here to assist,
	for they’re a distinct advance on your
	husky old Chancellors. Also, there’s a
	case of fairly good booze downstairs
	that the janitor is taking care of until
	you call for it. So long, fellows!”
	And with a wave of his hat the Goat
	departed.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap17.png" width="122" height="117" alt="M" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Miss Miriam Whiting</span>
	languidly descended
	the broad terrace
	steps. If her slow
	progress suggested
	bodily weariness, her
	whole bearing was not
	less indicative of spiritual lassitude.
	She allowed her hand to stray indolently
	along the balustrade, as with the
	other she held the lace-covered sunshade
	at a careless angle over her
	shoulder.</p>

	<p>On the lawn the guests from outside
	were gathered. Collected in groups or
	wandering in pairs, they dotted the
	grounds. As one of those staying in
	the house, she appeared as a semi-official
	hostess with a modified duty of seeing
	that all went as well as possible.
	Her head ached slightly, as she began
	to discover. Even the light of the late
	afternoon was trying. The dress which
	she expected to wear had proved too
	dilapidated, and she had been obliged
	to put on one she wished to save for
	more important occasions. The invitation
	which she needed for the satisfactory
	conduct of her modish itineracy
	from country house to country house
	had not come in the early mail as she
	expected.</p>

	<p>The band, hidden in a small, thick
	boscage of the wide gardens, broke into
	a mockingly cheerful air. At intervals
	some distant laugh taunted her. She
	was late, she knew. The shadows had
	begun to lengthen across the open
	spaces by the fountain, and she could
	almost see Mrs. Gunnison’s tart and
	ominous frown of displeasure. Why
	was she there, except to be seen; so
	that the world should know that one
	who had just come from the Kingsmills’
	place on the Hudson had paused beneath
	the broad roofs of “Highlands”
	before, presumably, going to the Van
	Velsors, in Newport?</p>

	<p>As with pinched lips she reflected,
	she quickened her pace carefully.</p>

	<p>“Ah, senator!” she cried, as she held
	out her hand with regulated effusion.
	“I am so charmed. I did not know that
	you were to be here. You great ones of
	the earth are so busy and so much in
	demand——”</p>

	<p>Senator Grayson bowed and beamed.
	He shifted in uneasy gratification from
	one foot to the other, and a rosier red
	showed in his round face.</p>

	<p>“I did not think that you young ladies
	noticed us old politicians——”</p>

	<p>“Every one should be given the benefit
	of a doubt. Of course, in our silly
	lives there is not very much chance to
	know about anything really worth
	while, but when a thing is really great
	even we cannot help hearing about it.
	Your last speech—the broad, far-reaching
	views——”</p>

	<p>The senator stood in agreeable embarrassment.</p>

	<p>“I read it,” Miriam continued. “I
	could not go to sleep, because I wanted
	to finish it. Of course, I could not understand
	all, but I was entranced. Even
	I could feel the force and eloquence. I
	have heard of nothing else.”</p>

	<p>“Really?” cried the enchanted statesman.
	“Do you know I thought it had
	fallen flat? You are good to tell me.
	These side-lights are of the utmost
	value, and, indeed, I esteem your opinion.
	Would you let me get out a cup
	of tea? And—and—Mrs. Grayson was
	only saying the other day that she
	wanted to ask you to come to Washington
	for a visit this winter.”</p>

	<p>As the senator stumbled away, Miss
	Whiting felt a light touch at her elbow.</p>

	<p>“In your most popular and successful
	manner, Miriam,” said a slight, slim
	woman, whom she found standing beside
	her.</p>

	<p>“He’s a dear, if he is an old goose,”
	said Miriam, defiantly. “And, of course,
	any shading would be lost on him.”</p>

	<p>“I know,” continued the other, the
	sharp brown eyes in her lean brown face
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>regarding the girl critically. “There
	are degrees of flattery even in your flattering.
	You have reduced it—or elevated
	it—to the proud position of an
	exact science.”</p>

	<p>Before Miriam could reply, a young
	man who had discovered her from afar
	advanced with what was evidently an
	unusual degree of precipitancy.</p>

	<p>“Miss Whiting, I am delighted,” he
	puffed. “I have been looking for you
	everywhere. I was in town, and I
	went to that bric-a-brac shop. The fan
	is undoubtedly a real Jacques Callot.”</p>

	<p>“I was sure,” she murmured, “with
	your knowledge and taste, that you
	could decide at once. Of course, I did
	not know.”</p>

	<p>“And—and——” hesitated the youth,
	“I hope that you will not be offended.
	I told them to send it to you here. If
	you will accept it?”</p>

	<p>“How terrible—and how kind of
	you!” Miriam cried, holding out both
	hands, as if led by an irresistible impulse.
	“But you are so generous. All
	your friends have discovered that. I
	always think of St. Francis sharing his
	cloak with the blind beggar.”</p>

	<p>“So good of you,” he stuttered. “It’s
	nothing. You must be tired. Can’t I
	bring a chair for you? I am going to
	get one.”</p>

	<p>As the young man turned hurriedly
	away, Miriam grasped her companion’s
	arm.</p>

	<p>“I never thought that he would give
	it to me. Never, Janet—honestly,” she
	exclaimed, with earnestness.</p>

	<p>“The way of the transgressor is likely
	to be strewn—with surprises.”</p>

	<p>“I only thought of saying something
	pleasant at a dinner.”</p>

	<p>“I’d taken Bengy Wade’s opinion
	without a moment’s hesitation on the
	length of a fox terrier’s tail, but a
	fan——”</p>

	<p>“He wants to be considered artistic,”
	pleaded Miriam.</p>

	<p>“And the last touch about St. Francis,
	wasn’t that a trifle overdone? Somewhat
	too thickly laid on? What used
	to be called by painters in a pre-impressionistic
	age—too great <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">impasto</em>. I am
	afraid that you are a little deteriorating.”</p>

	<p>“Miriam!”</p>

	<p>Both turned, and found a tall lady
	calling with as great animation as a
	due regard for the requirements of a
	statuesque pose permitted.</p>

	<p>“I want to speak to you,” she exclaimed,
	as soon as words were possible.
	“I want you to come to my house
	to-morrow morning. I am going to
	have a little music. Emmeline is going
	to sing.”</p>

	<p>“Oh!” cried Miriam.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you like her singing?” the
	other inquired, earnestly.</p>

	<p>“Oh, <em>very</em> much,” assured Miriam.
	“Only—the truth is, I once heard her
	sing Brunnhilde’s ‘Awakening,’ and
	she murdered it so horribly.”</p>

	<p>“Emmeline is often too ambitious,”
	the other commented, with visible content.</p>

	<p>“Lighter things she can do charmingly,
	and she should hold to them,” Miriam
	announced, with decision.</p>

	<p>“I arranged the program,” said the
	lady, “and, for her own sake, I shall
	not let her attempt anything to which
	she is unequal. Of course, I shall not
	sing myself.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, Mrs. Ogden!”</p>

	<p>“You know I never sing anything but
	Wagner, and then only when there are
	a few—when my hearers are in full
	sympathy. You will be sure to come,”
	she added, as she turned to give another
	invitation. “By the way, you will
	be at Westbrook this autumn. I want
	you to ride Persiflage in the hunt as
	often as you like.”</p>

	<p>“Much better,” commented Miriam’s
	companion, as they strayed on. “Of
	course, nothing would please her—as a
	bitter rival—more than to hear her sister-in-law’s
	singing abused. That touch
	about lighter things was masterly when
	she herself only sings Wagner for a
	few. But how do you manage with
	Emmeline?”</p>

	<p>“I tell her that no one can conduct,
	an automobile as she does.”</p>

	<p>“My dear!”</p>

	<p>“It’s an amusing game,” the girl answered.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>“But is it a safe one?”</p>

	<p>“Why not?” she exclaimed, challengingly.</p>

	<p>The two advanced toward the spreading
	marquee which appeared to be the
	center of the mild social maelstrom. A
	greater ebullition perceptibly marked
	the spot. The conflict of voices arose
	more audibly. Many were constantly
	drawn inward, while by some counter-current
	others were, frequently cast outward
	to continue in drifting circles until
	again brought back to the gently agitated
	center. On the very edge of this
	vortex—the heart of which was the
	long table beneath the tent—sat a goodly
	sized lady. Her appearance might
	have been offered by a necromancer as
	the proof of a successfully accomplished
	trick, for the small camp stool on which
	she rested was so thoroughly concealed
	from sight that she might have been
	considered to rest upon air. Catching
	sight of Miriam, she beckoned to her
	with a vigor that threatened disruption
	of her gloves.</p>

	<p>“Where have you been?” she cried,
	as Miriam and her friend approached.
	“I have been waiting for you. So many
	have been asking for you. I expected
	you to be here.”</p>

	<p>“My dear Mrs. Gunnison,” cooed the
	girl, “you must forgive me. Absolutely,
	I could not help myself. I was all
	ready on time—but I have been admiring
	again your wonderful house. And
	I have been wondering at the perfect
	way in which it is kept up—the faultless
	manner in which everything is managed.
	I can only think of Lord Wantham’s
	place. Though, of course, there
	is not the brilliancy there——”</p>

	<p>“I like to have things nice about me,”
	said Mrs. Gunnison, complacently. “Sit
	down here, my dear. I want to have
	you near me. And you, too, Mrs.
	Brough.”</p>

	<p>“I may be a little to blame for keeping
	Miriam,” said the elder woman. “I
	have been so much interested in what
	she was saying.”</p>

	<p>“Every one is,” responded Mrs. Gunnison,
	warmly. “Miriam is so popular—quite
	celebrated, for it. Indeed, there
	are numbers of people here who want
	to meet her. One young man in particular—Mr.
	Leeds——”</p>

	<p>“Did he say he wished to know me?”
	the girl asked, quickly.</p>

	<p>“Well, no,” admitted Mrs. Gunnison,
	“But then I want you to know each
	other. I’m quite bent on it. Nothing
	could be better. I’d like to see it come
	out the way I’d have it. You know how
	rich he is. And they say he is going to
	be somebody. Mr. Leeds! Mr. Leeds!”</p>

	<p>A tall young man looked and advanced.
	While his gait did not indicate
	reluctance, there was nothing that
	seemed to reveal eagerness. He came
	forward deliberately and stopped before
	the party.</p>

	<p>“<em>I</em> don’t think, Mr. Leeds, that you
	know Miss Whiting,” Mrs. Gunnison
	announced. “A dear friend of mine—and
	a dear. Mrs. Brough and you are
	old friends. You see her so often that
	I feel that I can take her away. Come,
	I want to show you something.”</p>

	<p>With her customary smile of unconcerned
	intelligence, Mrs. Brough allowed
	herself to be drawn off. The
	young man slowly settled himself in the
	chair which Mrs. Gunnison had left.</p>

	<p>“Oh, you shall not escape,” declared
	Miriam. “Mr. Leeds, I am so glad to
	be able to speak to you at last. I have
	so much to say to you. They told me
	that you would be here this afternoon.
	I wondered if I should see you.”</p>

	<p>Leeds had not spoken, but looked at
	the girl with a steadiness which for a
	moment caused her to cast down her
	animated eyes.</p>

	<p>“I missed you everywhere last winter,”
	she went on, more slowly. “And,
	of course, heard of you always.”</p>

	<p>Leeds continued to inspect the girl
	with amusement in his glance.</p>

	<p>“Oh, how splendid accomplishing
	something must be—standing for something!”</p>

	<p>“Don’t you think that you are rather
	overvaluing my modest achievements?”</p>

	<p>“Of course, you speak that way, but
	others do not,” she hurried on. “You
	are known from one end of the country
	to the other.”</p>

	<p>“Really——” he began.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>“To be such an inspiring influence
	in local politics——”</p>

	<p>“Because,” he laughed, “having a
	minor public position—because, by a
	fluke, having found myself in the place
	of a common councilman, I have got
	some things done and kept others from
	being done.”</p>

	<p>“Public life has always been so absorbing
	for me. I can think of nothing
	nobler for a man.”</p>

	<p>“Than being a common councilman,”
	he interrupted.</p>

	<p>“You laugh,” she said. “But I grew
	so interested, I followed in the newspapers,
	from day to day, what you were
	doing.”</p>

	<p>“You were very good,” he answered,
	gravely. “Or you are very good to say
	so.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t you believe me?” she asked,
	suddenly arrested by his tone.</p>

	<p>“I have heard a good deal of you,
	Miss Whiting.”</p>

	<p>Miriam flushed slightly, but she
	looked at him steadily.</p>

	<p>“What have you heard?”</p>

	<p>“I have heard that you have ways
	of making the worse appear the better
	reason—that you flatter.”</p>

	<p>The glow deepened in her face and
	her eyes flashed.</p>

	<p>“And,” he went on, lightly, “why
	should not one try to make the world
	pleasanter by making it more satisfied
	with itself? Isn’t that the part of a public
	benefactor?”</p>

	<p>“You are laughing at me,” she cried.
	“You—are—despising me.”</p>

	<p>“No, indeed,” he answered, with real
	earnestness. “You misunderstand me.
	Isn’t it only fair to give back in pleasant
	speeches the admiration and adulation
	that the world gives you? There
	would be a certain dishonesty in taking
	all and giving nothing.”</p>

	<p>“You—you—are mocking me,” she
	gasped, rising, as if to fly, and then sinking
	back.</p>

	<p>“No,” he answered, “only I object to
	being mocked myself. I’d rather not
	be included with all the others to be
	given pleasant words, as you can so easily
	give them out of a large supply. I’d
	prefer to have you think better of me
	than to believe that I am to be treated
	in that way.”</p>

	<p>“Mr. Leeds, you are abominable and
	rude—and I cannot listen to you.”</p>

	<p>“I am sorry. Honestly, when you began
	to make such—civil speeches to me
	I was disappointed. It was so exactly
	what I had been told to expect.”</p>

	<p>Miriam bit her lips—and her hand
	trembled a little on the handle of the
	sunshade.</p>

	<p>“I may have lost my temper a little,”
	he said, “which one should never do—but
	I can’t take anything back.”</p>

	<p>That afternoon Miss Whiting was
	strangely silent. Held at the opening
	of the tent by her hostess, people passed
	before her unseen. What she said she
	hardly knew. What her words meant
	she could not have told. She was only
	aware that her voice sounded unnatural,
	and that her laugh—when laugh she
	must—struck discordantly and strangely
	on her ears. She felt that the time
	would never come when she could be
	alone—to think.</p>

	<h3><abbr title="two">II</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Mrs. Gunnison’s dinners, like all else
	of the establishment, were always large.
	The classic limits authoritatively imposed
	she would have scorned—if she
	had ever heard of them. If she could
	have timed it, the greater the number
	of minutes required by the procession
	to the dining room in passing a given
	point, the better she would have been
	satisfied. She only felt that she “entertained”
	when she beheld serried
	ranks of guests stretching away from
	her on either hand. Therefore, when
	Miriam turned and discovered Leeds at
	her right, they found themselves in such
	semi-isolation as only exists at a very
	large dinner table.</p>

	<p>“I am sorry,” he said, pleadingly.</p>

	<p>“So am I,” she answered. “Very—oh,
	you think I mean that to be pleasant
	in that way, too——”</p>

	<p>She hastily averted her face, and engaged
	vigorously in conversation with
	the man on the other side. Leeds stared
	moodily before him. During the passing
	of the many courses which Mrs.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>Gunnison’s idea of fitting ceremony demanded,
	the lady whom he had taken in
	found him neither communicative nor
	responsive. The dinner dragged on.
	Miss Whiting’s soft right shoulder remained
	constantly turned on him. Her
	discourses, which he could not help
	hearing, continued actively and unceasingly.
	At last Mrs. Gunnison darted
	restless glances about. She had already
	begun to stir uneasily in her chair.</p>

	<p>Miriam suddenly veered round upon
	him.</p>

	<p>“I want to tell you something,” she
	almost whispered. “What I said—what
	I tried to say this afternoon was true.”</p>

	<p>He looked at her with fixed earnestness.</p>

	<p>“Oh!” she cried, passionately. “I
	can’t bear to have you study me as if
	I were a specimen of something—of
	mendacity, you think. But no matter
	about that. You must believe me.
	Don’t you?”</p>

	<p>“How can I,” he answered, slowly,
	“with——”</p>

	<p>“With my reputation,” she caught up,
	quickly, as he paused. “Do not try to
	spare me—now. Can’t you hear—can’t
	you see, now, that I am speaking the
	truth?”</p>

	<p>He gazed at her without answering.</p>

	<p>“Oh, I can read in your eyes that
	you do not. I want you to believe me.
	Can’t you believe—even that?”</p>

	<p>He shook his head half smilingly.</p>

	<p>“You do not know all that I have
	heard,” he answered.</p>

	<p>“Who can have been so unfair—so
	cruel? I—I never wanted to be believed
	so before. Oh, you think that is only a
	part of it; that the habit is so strong
	with me—that I am only flattering.”</p>

	<p>“If I have been—warned,” Leeds
	continued.</p>

	<p>“As if I were a peril—an evil——”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps you might be,” he muttered.</p>

	<p>“I will not bear it. You <em>shall</em> believe
	me. I am not flattering.”</p>

	<p>“At least, that you should have been
	willing to take the trouble to try was
	in itself a distinction.”</p>

	<p>“You are hard on me.”</p>

	<p>“I must protect myself.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Gunnison had arisen, and a rustling
	stir was spreading down the table.</p>

	<p>“I am not a harpy,” she cried.</p>

	<p>“A siren was a bird more beautiful,
	but not less dangerous,” he said.</p>

	<p>She rose straightly and swiftly.</p>

	<p>“You feel that you can speak to me
	like that because you believe I am what
	you think. Very well. There may be
	satisfaction for you to know it. I am,
	then, everything that you have implied.
	More—more than you have said. I am
	false. I do flatter people—cajole them—deceive.
	I do it for my own interest.
	Now are you satisfied? Could anything
	be worse? I confess, even, that I have
	deserved the way you have treated me.”</p>

	<p>“Believe me——” he began, hastily.</p>

	<p>But she had swept from him, and,
	amid the group of retreating women, he
	found no chance to finish the sentence.</p>

	<h3><abbr title="three">III</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>Miriam Whiting said “good-night”
	very early. A greater accuracy might
	demand the statement that the time at
	which she had “gone upstairs” was relatively
	not late—for the hours of the
	house were expansive, and not only had
	morning a way of extending into afternoon,
	but midnight into morning. As a
	general thing, she had only disappeared
	with her hostess, but on this particular
	evening she pleaded weariness—sleepiness—had
	even hinted at a headache,
	which no one had ever known her to
	have. Thereupon she departed, followed
	by the reproaches of the rest.
	Once in her room, she hurried her maid,
	and, finally, abruptly dismissed her.
	When she was alone, she went to the
	window and threw wide both the shutters.
	She leaned with her elbows on
	the sill, gazing out at the moonlit country.</p>

	<p>Perfectly round, with a burnished sky
	about it, such as may sometimes be seen
	when the circle is absolutely full, the
	white disk hung in the heavens. Below,
	about the quiet edges of the fountain,
	the light lay with silken sheen.
	Only, where the drops fell tremulously,
	the water was broken into glittering
	sparks. All was very still. Far off a dog
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>barked fitfully. That was the one sound
	which broke the silence, with the exception
	of the occasional distant laughter
	of some men on the terrace at the
	end of the spreading wing. With her
	fingers buried in her thick hair, carefully
	gathered for the night, she looked
	straight before her, although she was
	wholly unconscious of the scene.</p>

	<p>A light knock at the door was repeated
	twice before she heard it and
	spoke.</p>

	<p>“It’s I,” the voice said, insistently.
	“May I come in?”</p>

	<p>“Of course,” Miriam answered, without
	moving.</p>

	<p>The door opened quickly, and a small
	figure darted into the room.</p>

	<p>“There was some one coming,” said
	Mrs. Brough, as she glanced down at
	the voluminous silken folds in which
	her little body was lost. “I am not in a
	condition to be seen—generally.”</p>

	<p>She came forward slowly.</p>

	<p>“My room is near yours. I saw your
	light. I thought that you had not gone
	to sleep. I wanted to come to speak to
	you.” She put her hands on Miriam’s
	shoulder. “You have been crying.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” said Miriam, quietly.</p>

	<p>“I saw at dinner that you were not
	yourself—and I am troubled, too. I
	have a confession to make.”</p>

	<p>Miriam looked at her curiously.</p>

	<p>“You know that I am your friend—now,”
	the other went on. “Since we
	have been here together, we have come
	to know each other as I never thought
	that we should. There was a time before,
	though, when I did not understand
	so well. I had watched you, and I did
	not like you. I distrusted you—or, rather,
	did not trust you——”</p>

	<p>“I understand. You were clever
	enough to see through me——”</p>

	<p>“I thought that with your—insincerities
	that you were all false. I should
	have been wise enough to know differently.
	But what will you?—to assume
	evil is easy, and always gives one a
	proud sense of superior perspicacity. I
	condemned you, Miriam, without a
	hearing, and I told Arthur Leeds.”</p>

	<p>“You did it?” the girl murmured,
	dully.</p>

	<p>“Yes, I warned him.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“Because I like him and admire him,
	and I thought you—dangerous.”</p>

	<p>“That is why he has said the things
	he has.”</p>

	<p>“He has said something?”</p>

	<p>“He has told me that I am not worthy
	of regard or consideration or respect.”</p>

	<p>“Impossible!”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps not directly—but he has implied
	that and more—by word and action.
	And—and—I love him.”</p>

	<p>Mrs. Brough sat down quickly in the
	chair which she had drawn up, and took
	Miriam’s hands.</p>

	<p>“I know you so well now,” she said,
	“that at dinner I saw something was
	wrong. I did not realize that it was as
	bad as that.”</p>

	<p>“I think I loved him even last winter,
	when I only saw him—heard who he
	was—and did not know him. I admired
	and respected and reverenced him. But
	he seemed different to me. And to-day
	when I met him I wanted to tell him a
	little—as much as I could—of what I
	thought. I wanted him to know something
	of the feeling that I had. I
	wanted to please him. I wanted him to
	be nice to me—because I pleased him.
	What I said to him was true—true.”</p>

	<p>She sprang to her feet, and spoke in
	deep, tragic tones.</p>

	<p>“True!” she repeated. “And I have
	lost the power of being thought true.
	My words can only be considered so
	many counterfeits. I have so often debased
	the true metal of sincerity that
	anything I say must ring false—that
	anything I may give cannot be taken.
	What I said sounded fraudulently in my
	own ears. I could not forget the many,
	many times when I had spoken so
	nearly in the same way without meaning
	or belief, and each speech seemed
	to me a mockery. Though I longed
	with all of me to speak simply and sincerely—knowing
	that I spoke the truth—I
	hardly seemed to myself to be doing
	it. All appeared a part, but a repetition
	of the many times before when I had
	played a part—when what I did was a
	comedy—a farce—a tragedy!”</p>

	<p>She broke off with a sob.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>“You have cried wolf pretty often,”
	avowed Mrs. Brough.</p>

	<p>“I am a Cassandra,” said the girl, instantly.
	“When I wish to be believed I
	cannot. When all that is most precious
	and dearest to me depends on it I cannot
	be trusted. I may speak, but I shall
	not be heard—when all my life is in being
	heard—I know it.”</p>

	<p>“You see,” said Mrs. Brough, “when
	I told him I thought of you as you
	seemed——”</p>

	<p>“As I was. I don’t blame you,” Miriam
	cried, bitterly. “What I had become!
	Let me tell you.” She sat down
	again, and, with her elbows on her
	knees and her chin on her hands, gazed
	fixedly at the other. “I think I began
	innocently enough. I wanted to be liked—and
	I fell into the way of saying
	pleasant little things. I tried to make
	everybody contented and pleased with
	me. That was when I came out. Indeed,
	I may say for myself that I had a
	sympathetic nature. I could not bear
	to see anyone uncomfortable or doubtful
	about themselves or anything, without
	trying to help them. Surely that
	was not bad?”</p>

	<p>“No,” said Mrs. Brough, slowly.</p>

	<p>“I really wished to help every one,”
	she continued. “And the best way that
	I found to do it was to say pleasant
	things. It was easy—too fatally easy.
	When I discovered how popular this
	made me I kept on. I continued for
	myself what I had really begun for others.
	Insensibly I acquired skill. I was
	not stupid. I had rather a gift for character—and
	could say exactly the thing
	to each one to flatter them the most.
	I found that I took pleasure in the
	exercise of such cleverness. There was
	a feeling of power in it—playing with
	the foibles and weaknesses of men and
	women. I did not see that I was often
	trafficking in unworthiness and baseness.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve no doubt you did harm,” concluded
	Mrs. Brough. “People are only
	too willing to be encouraged in their
	vanities. I don’t think, Miriam, that
	you were really very good for a person’s
	character.”</p>

	<p>“I was not very good for my own,”
	Miriam went on, grimly. “I retrograded.
	I can see it now. In playing
	on the follies and faults of others, I
	grew less careful—less critical myself.
	Then the family lost its money. Oh, I
	haven’t the poor excuse that I was in
	want—that what I did was done from
	any lack of anything essential for myself
	or others. Ours was just a commonplace,
	undramatic loss—with only
	need for saving and retrenchment.
	Without the deprivation of a single necessity,
	or comfort, even. Merely the
	absence of the luxuries. The luxuries,
	though, in a way, had become necessities
	to me—and—I found, by exercising
	my power, I could get much that I
	wished. I flattered and cajoled to
	please people, so that they would do
	things for me, give me things. That is
	ended——”</p>

	<p>She pointed dramatically to a table.</p>

	<p>“There is the fan from Bengy Wade
	in a package. To-morrow it goes back
	to him. There is a note to Mrs. Grayson,
	declining her invitation. If I go
	to Westbrook I shall not ride Persiflage.
	I have turned over a new leaf.
	But the degradation of thinking of the
	record on the old ones! If I could
	only tear them out instead of trying to
	fold them down. I see it all now. He
	has made me see it all. He has made
	me despise myself until I see the way
	I look in his eyes; until I seem the
	same in my own. Janet, what can I
	do?”</p>

	<p>The girl’s head bent on the arm of the
	chair, as her body was shaken with
	sobs. The other put out her hand and
	gently stroked her heavy hair.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you exaggerate?”</p>

	<p>“Did you,” Miriam panted, “when
	you said what you did to Mr. Leeds?
	Did you make my blackness less black
	than it should be—did you concede to
	me any saving light?”</p>

	<p>“I did not know. If I can do anything
	now——”</p>

	<p>“You must not speak to him,” Miriam
	cried, sitting up abruptly. “There
	would be no use. When the seeds of
	distrust have been sown they will grow,
	even if the weeds crowd out everything
	else.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"> </a>“But weeds can be dug up.”</p>

	<p>“That must be my part,” Miriam answered,
	more calmly. “Only one course
	is left. It’s funny,” she smiled, swiftly,
	through her tears. “There is poetic
	justice in it. I can do only one thing.
	It is my retribution.”</p>

	<h3><abbr title="four">IV</abbr>.</h3>

	<p>The announcement which Mrs. Gunnison
	made on the following morning
	came as a surprise to Miriam. She had
	some difficulty in not displaying an undue
	excitement. The habit of containment,
	which had come with worldly experience,
	however, did not fail her. She
	heard her hostess state that Arthur
	Leeds was coming to stay in the house
	without any exhibition of visible emotion.
	Mrs. Gunnison said that, as the
	Barlows had other people coming, he
	was going to transfer himself to “Highlands,”
	and that he would arrive in time
	for luncheon. Any fears which Miriam
	experienced were wholly offset by a
	devout thankfulness. The event offered
	such an occasion for the carrying
	out of her plan as she had not hoped
	to have given her. In the promise of
	such an admirable opportunity for the
	execution of her purpose, she found a
	melancholy satisfaction. If, as she
	thought to herself, the iron was to enter
	her soul, the sooner the affair was
	accomplished the better. The process
	of self-sacrifice was not pleasant in the
	execution, however glorious it might
	appear in the conception. Self-immolation
	might be a duty, but, as every martyrdom,
	it was more satisfactory as an
	ideal than as a fact.</p>

	<p>The first opportunity which came to
	execute what she had laboriously
	planned was during the aimless inoccupation
	of after luncheon idleness. The
	arrangements for the afternoon had not
	yet been concluded, but were in the
	careless making. Who should ride;
	who should drive; who should walk;
	who should go and who should stay;
	the what and whither had not been settled:
	Leeds strolled to her side.</p>

	<p>“I have been trying to speak to you,
	but you have avoided me.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

	<p>“Why?” he asked;
	“I am going to tell you the truth,
	now——” she paused, and looked at
	him.</p>

	<p>“Why?” he repeated.</p>

	<p>“Because I think that you are the
	most detestable man I ever saw,” she
	answered, gazing squarely at him.</p>

	<p>He started slightly—glanced at her
	in surprise, and abruptly sat down on
	the divan beside her.</p>

	<p>“You have really come to that conclusion?”
	he asked.</p>

	<p>“I have always believed it,” she answered,
	firmly.</p>

	<p>“But you said——”</p>

	<p>“You told me that I was a flatterer.
	I shall not be with <em>you</em> any longer.
	You wish the truth. You shall have it.”</p>

	<p>“That is what you thought from the
	first?” he said, slowly.</p>

	<p>“Yes,” she answered, less clearly. “I
	have always understood that you were
	most absurdly self-satisfied. That you
	are deluded by a pose as to which you
	are so weak as to deceive yourself.
	That you take yourself with a seriousness
	which leads you to believe that you
	are preaching a crusade when you are
	only blowing a penny whistle. That
	you assume that you have made for
	yourself a position and a reputation
	which were made for you.”</p>

	<p>“What do you mean?” he asked,
	quietly.</p>

	<p>“You have an old name and a large
	fortune which rendered you conspicuous
	and made everything easy. The
	newspapers have talked of you only as
	they would anyway. Indeed, they would
	have given more space to you if you
	had a liking for conducting an automobile
	painted like a barber’s pole than
	they have because you went into politics.
	They would have preferred the
	striped automobile, but they had to be
	content with the ‘reform politics’ as the
	freak of one in your place.”</p>

	<p>“Then you think I am—nothing?”</p>

	<p>“You are a rich young man of assured
	position—spoiled by the world.”</p>

	<p>“I thought I had, at least, ordinary
	common sense.”</p>

	<p>“Probably—but still you have unduly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>lost your head. You would not know
	if people were laughing at you——”</p>

	<p>Leeds flushed slightly. Miriam
	caught her breath sharply, and reached
	forward to take up a fan which lay
	within her reach.</p>

	<p>“I am altogether a monster?”</p>

	<p>“No,” she replied, calmly. “A very
	ordinary young man, I should say.”</p>

	<p>“I’d be kind to dumb animals and not
	kick a baby——”</p>

	<p>“I am quite serious,” she answered.
	“You objected to any little pleasantness
	on my part because what I said might
	not be altogether sincere. Now we are
	going to have facts. Indeed, you are
	the type of man I dislike.”</p>

	<p>“At least, we know where we are
	now,” he responded.</p>

	<p>“Yes. And as we are staying in the
	same house it may be as well.”</p>

	<p>Miriam rose slowly. She walked decidedly
	across the room, and ostentatiously
	placed herself beside Mrs. Gunnison.
	Leeds, deserted, did not move.
	He sat staring at the floor, as he softly
	drummed with his fingers on the couch’s
	leather arm.</p>

	<p>As well as in certain other particulars,
	the life of a country house is microcosmical
	in this—escape from the requirements
	of human relationship is
	impossible. Indeed, the demands are
	made greater, the bonds more firmly
	fixed. In fact, the condition of all may
	be more fitly described as the condition
	of two united in matrimony—they take
	each other for better or worse. Constantly
	through the day they must meet.
	The terms on which they are thrown
	together impose intimacy. If latent
	antipathy exists with the revealing
	conditions of constant companionship
	it must be discovered. If inherent
	sympathy is to be found the two gravitate
	toward each other with inevitable
	certainty. As the birthplace of aversion
	quickly reaching a maturity of detestation
	and hate; as the hothouse of
	interest growing speedily into full
	bloom of liking and love, there is no
	place like a country house. All existence
	there, in its condensed form, is
	a forcing process. Without any awkwardly
	abrupt transition or disconnecting
	jolts, those who begin to talk about
	mutual friends in the morning may
	easily reach a discussion of their own
	souls in the afternoon, and be far on
	the broad and easy path of sentiment
	by evening. Like or dislike, more or
	less strong, must surely and quickly
	follow. There is in the social chemistry
	a certainty of repulsion or attraction,
	out of which the most unexpected
	combinations result—of a surprisingly
	lasting nature.</p>

	<p>In the daily routine Miriam saw
	Leeds constantly. Though she might
	come down late for breakfast, she always
	found him. Even if she breakfasted
	in her room, when she descended
	he was always smoking in the hall.</p>

	<p>“I did not expect to stay so long,”
	he explained to her on one occasion,
	rising as she paused at the foot of the
	stairs.</p>

	<p>“Then why do you?” she asked, coldly.</p>

	<p>“Don’t you know?” he demanded.
	“Should you feel it pleasanter if I went
	away?”</p>

	<p>“Really—as I have undertaken to be
	perfectly frank with you—how can
	your going or staying make the least
	difference in the world to me?”</p>

	<p>“Still,” he said, looking at her curiously,
	“there must be something tiresome
	in having to be scorning somebody
	all the time.”</p>

	<p>“I think,” she said, briefly, “I hear
	voices in the billiard room. I am going
	in there.”</p>

	<p>If at dinner Leeds found himself
	next to her he discovered that she
	spoke to him no more than the strict
	letter of the law governing the conduct
	of guests in the same house demanded.
	What she said was of the most indifferent
	nature. If he sought to reach a
	more personal basis he found himself
	checked.</p>

	<p>“Miss Whiting,” he said, suddenly,
	on the third evening, “I am going away
	to-morrow morning.”</p>

	<p>Miriam swung about swiftly.</p>

	<p>“To-morrow!” she exclaimed, with
	a catch in her voice.</p>

	<p>“Yes, I think I had better go, though
	there is something I want to tell you
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>before I do. I have thought of all that
	you have said. I have profited by the
	new light that you have thrown upon
	myself—my actions—my life.”</p>

	<p>“What do you mean?” she murmured.</p>

	<p>“I have realized that very likely I
	am a prig. I understand the futility of
	what I am trying to do. I see that I
	have been mistaken in my power. I’m
	going to give up.”</p>

	<p>“Give up?” she replied.</p>

	<p>“You have shown that I was attempting
	more than I was able to do. The
	Donaldsons have asked me to go in
	their yacht round the world. The <em>Vierna</em>
	starts on Thursday. I am going
	away to be lazy and careless, and live
	the life for which you think I’m fitted.”</p>

	<p>“You are going to give up everything?”
	she exclaimed.</p>

	<p>“Yes,” he answered. “It is your
	doing. You must take the responsibility
	of it.”</p>

	<p>“But what I say—what I think, can
	make no difference,” she almost entreated.
	“I am not of enough importance
	to you—you cannot consider me
	enough——”</p>

	<p>“All that is something of which you
	know nothing,” he answered, gravely.
	“Something of which I have told you
	nothing. I am going away—with the
	Donaldsons.”</p>

	<p>“People like that!” she interrupted.</p>

	<p>“People like that. I am going with
	them to lead their life—to be gone for
	a year, unless one thing happens. As
	I said, you are responsible.”</p>

	<p>“But I can’t be,” she implored. “It
	isn’t possible. I can’t count for anything.”</p>

	<p>“Let me assure you that you do.”</p>

	<p>“Then I can’t take the responsibility.
	I won’t.”</p>

	<p>“Unless one thing happens I am going,”
	he went on, inflexibly. “There
	are some, I think, who believe in me—who
	will think I am making a mistake.”</p>

	<p>“But your future—your career,” she
	began, and paused abashed, as she saw
	the way he watched her.</p>

	<p>“I thought we were to have no—insincerities—no
	flatteries. Since I know
	what you really think, such civil implications
	can mean nothing.”</p>

	<p>She bit her lips, pale as her cheeks
	were white.</p>

	<p>“Oh!” she cried, “how horrible!”</p>

	<p>Through all of dinner she hardly
	spoke. If she said nothing to Leeds,
	neither would she address the man on
	her other side, only giving such monosyllable
	answers as were necessary.
	The evening dragged slowly. Leeds
	did not approach her. Once or twice
	she looked toward him, but he did not
	appear to notice her. Indeed, he only
	came late from the smoking room and
	returned after a brief appearance in the
	big hall.</p>

	<p>“When,” she asked once, in a timid
	voice, of Mrs. Gunnison, “does Mr.
	Leeds go?”</p>

	<p>“The early train,” the lady answered.
	“I believe he leaves the house before
	seven, or at some equally unearthly
	hour.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p>The fresh sunlight of the early morning
	was flooding through the open hall
	door as Leeds came down the wide,
	main stairs. He saw, under the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</em>,
	the trap ready to take him to
	the station, and into which the second
	man, with the help of the groom, was
	lifting his trunk. Here and there a
	housemaid was busy with duster and
	cloth. The machinery of the establishment
	was being set in running condition,
	and there was the accompanying
	disorder. The place seemed strange
	and unfamiliar.</p>

	<p>“Your keys, sir,” the butler said,
	holding out the bunch.</p>

	<p>“Yes,” he answered, “I’m ready.”</p>

	<p>As he spoke he started. Clearly in
	the stillness of the morning he heard
	a few soft notes struck on the piano.
	At that hour the sound was most unusual.
	He listened. The Flower Music
	of “Parsifal.” With a swiftness that
	left the astonished butler staring after
	him, he darted toward a door. In a
	moment he had torn the portière aside
	and had crossed the polished floor of
	the music room. Miriam was seated at
	the piano, her fingers resting on the
	keys.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>“You are down!” he exclaimed.</p>

	<p>“Yes,” she answered, neither turning
	round nor looking up.</p>

	<p>“You are very early.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” she assented. Then she
	whirled about on the music stool. “I
	came down to see you.”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>Both spoke with a simple directness—with
	the manner of those dealing in
	ultimate moments with the unmistakable
	facts.</p>

	<p>“You told me last night that you
	were doing as you do because of what
	I have said. I cannot take the responsibility.
	I’d rather that you thought
	even worse of me than you do. Oh!”
	she cried, bending her head down on
	her hands, which clasped the rack of
	the piano. “I am, false—false! I cannot
	be true even in my falsity. All that
	I have been telling you is not the
	truth.”</p>

	<p>“Yes?” he interrupted, eagerly.</p>

	<p>“When you judged me—when you
	told me—or showed me what you
	thought of me—I recognized what I
	was doing—what I was. I saw I was
	false. My pride drove me to do something
	else. It was a punishment for
	myself—a price I must pay. As falsely
	as you thought I tried to please you—as
	falsely, <em>really</em>, I made myself hateful
	to you. I told you every untrue,
	miserable thing of which I could think.
	It seems as if any little remnant of
	dignity which I had demanded it. But
	to have you say that you were influenced
	by my lies—were going to give
	up so much that was splendid and great—because
	of them! Oh, you must believe
	me now. I could not bear it.”</p>

	<p>“Then you don’t think I am altogether
	contemptible?”</p>

	<p>“I think you are the finest and best
	and strongest man I know,” she said,
	bravely.</p>

	<p>On one knee, beside her, he had his
	arm about her.</p>

	<p>“Bless you, darling,” he cried. “Then
	I can tell the truth, too. I think that
	you are the dearest and sweetest woman,
	and I love you—love you!”</p>

	<p>“I—I don’t deserve it,” she sobbed.</p>

	<p>“I would not,” he said, “let myself
	believe what you told me at first, but
	then I would not let myself believe what
	you said afterward. I hoped——”</p>

	<p>“Oh, it was so hard for me. Can’t
	you understand? There was expiation
	in it. Don’t you think it enough?”</p>

	<p>“I think we have both been mistaken
	and unhappy.”</p>

	<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Since the
	first I have changed. It taught me a
	lesson. I am different—really.”</p>

	<p>“We’ll have everything all right now,
	and that is all.”</p>

	<p>“But you are going away,” she exclaimed.</p>

	<p>“I said I was going away unless one
	thing happened.”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” she said, eagerly.</p>

	<p>“Very well—it has happened.”</p>

	<p>The sound of the brush striking
	sharply and with metallic distinctness
	on a dustpan came from the room beyond.</p>

	<p>“Perhaps we had better go on the
	terrace,” he laughed. “Really, you
	know, we ought to have moonlight and
	mystery, but——”</p>

	<p>Together they went out through the
	open door into the fresh, soft morning
	air. The warm scent of the garden
	blew up to them. A large, yellow
	butterfly fluttered peacefully by. The
	dew still lay on leaf and flower, glittering
	in a thousand sparkles.</p>

	<p>“The night is the time for romance,”
	he said. “Any well managed proposal
	should be made under the stars.”</p>

	<p>“But the morning, such a morning,”
	she exclaimed, softly, and clasping her
	hands in ecstasy. “And as this is going
	to be a beginning for me, I like the
	morning better.”</p>

		<h2>THE SONG OF BROADWAY</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Robert Stewart</p>
	</div>
	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap19.png" width="120" height="117" alt="A" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">A certain</span> club of good
	fellows of both sexes,
	journalists, authors, illustrators,
	actors, men
	of pleasure, and Bohemians
	generally, used
	to gather on Sunday
	evenings, a merry decade ago, round
	the hospitable table of an Italian lady
	who had acquired her culinary accomplishments
	under the distinguished eye
	of M. Martin—late chef to M. de Lesseps,
	and present proprietor of Martin’s
	Restaurant—before she attempted to
	practice on her own account, so to
	speak, in the basement of a dingy brick
	house in West Twelfth Street.</p>

	<p>Signora Maria was a trusting soul
	in those days, and many a hungry poor
	devil has hung up his hat, coat and dinner
	there, and blessed his kind hostess
	as he quaffed her red ink. We didn’t
	say claret; we called out: “Where’s
	my red ink bottle, Maria?” And Maria
	would put down the soup tureen she
	was going from table to table with, and
	fetch us a pint of her <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ordinaire</em>. It was
	sour stuff certainly, which even Maria’s
	radiant smile couldn’t sweeten, but budding
	genius is careless of the morrow,
	and on Sunday evenings, especially,
	when Maria held her salon in the
	boarded back room, built out over the
	yard, vast quantities of it were gayly
	consumed, along with cigarettes, and
	coffee, and flaming <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pousse-cafés</em>.</p>

	<p>In one sense, at least, our function
	was appropriate to the night. Everybody
	“came prepared”—women and
	men both—like a country Experience
	Meeting. Jokes cracked like lightning
	through the tobacco clouds; songs of
	love and war trembled and roared
	above our heads; humor and pathos,
	those twin slaves of the lamp, sported
	and wept at our bidding; in a word, no
	end of youthful bombast, and kind
	laughter, and harmless, gratified vanity,
	was exhibited there. It was really
	more like a Montmartre <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</em> than
	any place I ever saw in New York.
	Only, with humblest apologies for disparaging
	their worldliness, the ladies
	were so evidently good, sincere, faithful
	friends, wives, mothers, sweethearts,
	that some of us watched their happy
	gayety with grateful, pleased eyes.</p>

	<p>A Judas came to that kindly board,
	and betrayed to a newspaper these
	merry, honest folk at their simple feast.
	Stupid, prosperous commercial persons
	pushed their way in and stared at them.
	They fled away, scared at last, to more
	inaccessible haunts.</p>

	<p>But on one particularly jolly evening,
	to return to a text memories of tried
	friends and happy hours have beguiled
	me from, among a number of notable
	guests one who “favored,” Mr. Wilton
	Lackaye, then appearing as that white-eyed,
	hairy, awful <em>Svengali</em> everybody
	so loathed and applauded, dramatically
	recited a remarkable and original poem
	called the “Song of Broadway.” Many
	a time since have I remembered the
	scene, the song, the company; the long,
	wine-stained tables, the eddying cigarette
	smoke, the acute, lively faces. In
	one way or another, everyone there was
	a trained observer, and knew his Broadway.</p>

	<p>It is rather a bold thing to say you
	know your Broadway. As I, too, sing
	my song about it, if I sound a note once
	or twice you have never heard, oh,
	thank Heaven, and turn away! With
	us, I trust, it will be but a minor chord.
	So every stroller there recognized the
	world he lives in, and the child, the
	mother, the cabby, gambler, pickpocket,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"> </a>doctor, parson, each carries off his or
	her own bundle of impressions.</p>

	<p>Leaving it, then, to graver historians
	to trace the financial, commercial and
	social evolution of this tremendous
	street, which was a forest trail once,
	within whose sylvan solitudes red men
	roamed and wild beasts prowled, let us
	from our humble station, as men of the
	world and social philosophers, describe
	merely that stretch of it which begins
	at Madison Square and ends at Forty-fifth
	Street; where it is high noon at
	eight o’clock at night, and bedtime
	when the gray dawn comes shivering
	cold and ghastly into hotel corridors
	where the washerwomen are scrubbing
	the marble floors. “Little old Broadway,”
	as it is affectionately toasted in
	the vernacular of its <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</em>, wherever
	rye whisky is drunk, and faithful homesick
	hearts recall its lights, its pleasures
	and its crowds.</p>

	<p>Broadway, I say, at eight o’clock at
	night, is the most fascinating street on
	earth. It is <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</em> every evening; and
	you have only to walk that mile often
	enough, and the whole town will display
	itself at leisure and at its ease, perfectly
	unconscious and natural and selfish.
	It is not the lights; it is not the
	brilliant hotels, and theaters, and restaurants,
	and shops, and tramcars, and
	hurrying cabs; it is not the music that
	floats out to you on the rippling surface
	of the town’s deep voice; it is not that
	voice itself, vibrating as it is with every
	emotion of the human heart, of pleasure,
	excitement, careless gayety, shame
	that has ceased to care, lust whispering
	its appeal, modesty’s shocked sigh, innocence’s
	happy prattle, kind laughter,
	friendly chat, unexpected hearty greetings;
	it is the vast, shifting, jostling,
	loitering, idle crowd, the multitude of a
	huge cosmopolitan city that is the spectacle,
	and that to a man who knows his
	town is more dramatic, and humorous,
	and pathetic, and fascinating than all
	the plays to which young ladies, and
	their papas, too, are hurrying, to thrill,
	and laugh, and cry over.</p>

	<p>Think of a mile of street, brilliant
	like a drawing room almost, and
	swarming with all kinds of men and
	women from all over the world, each
	seeking his or her particular amusement
	and finding it. Pleasure is the
	commodity on sale here, and one can
	obtain it at any of those glittering signs
	blazing out over the crush, or traffic in
	it with the venders of the pavement.</p>

	<p>Isn’t it marvelous? Isn’t it wonderful?
	as the conjurer says when he cuts
	your watch out of an onion. Mr. Conjurer
	returns your watch in safety, but
	it retains that delicate perfume which
	only the time it chronicles can wear
	away. Many an ingenious traveler has
	stepped out of his hotel to watch this
	magic spectacle for a little, and brought
	back with him bitter remembrances that
	all the tears shed secretly won’t ever
	wash out.</p>

	<p><em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tant pis!</em> You are not a preacher,
	monsieur. There is only one church on
	your Broadway, and that is dark and
	shut and sold to a syndicate. The only
	religion one gets here is the Bibles
	in the hotel bedrooms, and at Jerry McAuley’s
	Cremorne Mission, round the
	corner in Thirty-second Street. What,
	then? Nobody claims Broadway to be
	a domestic scene, and children and
	nursemaids don’t constitute its charm.</p>

	<p>Look north, from where we have
	turned into it, after lighting our cigars
	at Van Valkenburg’s, under the Albemarle
	Hotel, and those dazzling signs
	will tell you what most people come
	here for: Martin’s, Weber’s Music
	Hall, the Imperial Hotel, the Knickerbocker
	Theater, with Mr. Sothern in
	“Hamlet,” Hoster’s, Kid McCoy’s Café,
	Brown’s Chop House, Grand Opera,
	Rector’s Restaurant—to dine, to drink,
	to smoke, to stroll, to see the play, to
	watch each other. Did you ever see so
	much light, so much life? Halt where
	sedate business halts, too, at the St.
	James Building, frowning darkly down
	on gay, hoydenish Martin’s, whose
	roguish, Parisian eyes twinkle mischievously
	up at it, as if they know the tall,
	somber old hypocrite has a score of
	wicked theatrical agencies hidden away
	in its locked heart, and just <em>see!</em></p>

	<p>Straight ahead of you, within ten
	minutes’ brisk walk, are twenty theaters,
	sixteen hotels, six expensive restaurants,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"> </a>two huge department stores,
	the <cite>Herald</cite> newspaper palace, with the
	elevated road cutting across its face,
	several tall apartment houses thrusting
	up their lighted windows into the night,
	telegraph offices, bars, apothecaries,
	florists, confectioners, tobacconists,
	jewelry shops galore, all signed with
	electricity, and producing that wonderful
	glitter and glare that is both so
	bizarre and so enchanting. A street, do
	we call this? It is a scene, most theatrical
	and gorgeous, and set for the
	great human comedy which is even now
	being displayed upon it.</p>

	<p>In this theater you perceive audience
	and actor alike occupy the stage, as
	they used to do in the old London
	playhouses; and poor little flower girls
	are pushing their way through our
	throng, also offering the roses that fade
	so fast after they are plucked. Anything
	makes an interest, an excitement;
	a fire engine tearing across Thirty-sixth
	Street, a policeman marching a thief
	to the precinct house, an ambulance
	clanging down Sixth Avenue, a newsboy
	asleep on the Dime Savings Bank
	steps, the bronze hammers striking nine
	on the <cite>Herald</cite> clock, a Corean embassy
	driving up to Wallack’s Theater in their
	soft felt hats and gorgeous robes.</p>

	<p>Never were a lot of people more easy
	to be amused, more eager to laugh or
	sympathize. A gentleman’s hat blows
	up in the air; hoots of laughter explode
	after it. It rolls under an express van;
	a dozen citizens spring to its rescue.
	Nerves are on edge. Stimulants are
	exciting keen brains. It is a trifle savage,
	this crowd. Look! See them hustle
	that masher! His hat’s smashed already.
	The poor child he was persecuting
	is crying with fright. A woman,
	not given to such a pure embrace, has
	her arm about her; a big “plain-clothes
	man” is drying her eyes with his handkerchief;
	a couple of young stock brokers
	are bargaining with cabby on his
	box to drive her home. Ah, that is a
	pretty sight! I think Mr. Addison
	would have liked to see it, and Dick
	Steele, I know, would have slipped a
	bank note into her hand. Oh, burst of
	sunshine in the darkness! Oh, chivalry
	and kindness beaming out on fast
	Broadway! Oh, reckless, hardened
	sinners loving innocence and kneeling
	to it!</p>

	<p>But come; this is still Broadway. A
	block off they know nothing of all this.
	Above us Daly’s is closing and its fashionable
	audience pouring out on the
	pavement. In Twenty-ninth Street, the
	Cairo, the Alhambra, the Bohemia, are
	just as brilliant and fascinating as
	usual.</p>

	<p>I remember, one evening, as I was
	passing the ladies’ entrance to the Gilsey
	House, on my way home from
	the club, out comes a visiting family
	party—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monsieur et madame et sa fille</em>.
	Monsieur stops, buttoning up that
	“good frock coat,” the uniform of the
	American senator, which has proclaimed
	Squedunk through every capital
	in Europe. He stands, the oracle of
	the post office, the rich man of the
	county, the benignant elder of the Congregational
	church, gazing across the
	way at all the flaring signs toward
	Sixth Avenue.</p>

	<p>“Ah,” says he, smiling reminiscently,
	“the Midway. Let’s go and look at
	’em, my dears.”</p>

	<p>I had a wicked impulse to go, too,
	and see what happened. But I repressed
	it, and took the liberty to inform
	Mr. Smallville that those places
	were not especially recommended for
	ladies. I think miss was mortally offended
	with me for upsetting the program.</p>

	<p>Are other people secretly disappointed,
	too, because they can’t get a peep
	behind those closed doors? It was
	Madam Eve, I believe, who first tasted
	the apple; it was Pandora who lifted
	the lid of the box of troubles; propose
	a slumming party, and be sure it is the
	ladies who will applaud loudest. Well,
	then—those places, dear Miss Smallville
	are—very much like the zenanas
	the foreign missionaryess told you
	about last autumn in the church parlors.
	Now you know all about it. Ask
	your brother Tom if I’m not correct. I
	wager he can tell you if he chooses.</p>

	<p>It is a curious fact, by the way, that
	all the places which make Broadway
	<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"> </a>notorious are in the side streets. Just
	as it is a curious misnomer to call the
	toughest section of it the Tenderloin.
	Broadway has no slums. Laboring people,
	even, never make any distinguishable
	element in its populace. This is,
	of course, owing to its geographical
	position. But there is one fact which
	is immensely to its credit, and is perhaps
	due to the Irish who govern it, if
	they do prefer Fifth Avenue to parade
	in. For when Brian Boru—from whom
	every loyal Irishman is descended—was
	king, didn’t a beauteous damsel,
	with a ring of price, stroll unprotected
	and in safety over his kingdom? Beauteous
	damsels with rings of price certainly
	stroll unprotected over Broadway,
	but this is not the fact I emphasize.
	It is, seriously, that it is quite possible
	for young ladies to walk this fastest
	mile in the United States, with their
	papas and mammas, every evening, and
	write home to Kate that “it is just like
	Saturday night on Main Street, only
	bigger.” No sensible girl could promenade
	the Strand or the Bois after theater
	hours, no matter how chaperoned,
	and then make such a comparison.
	Huzza! I say. Huzza! It is America’s
	compliment to her women.</p>

	<p>Still, however decorously Broadway
	subdues its hilarity before the ladies,
	like a fast young man at a tea party,
	we all know it is not in the least like
	Saturday night on Main Street. Let us
	saunter along, like two men of the
	world, perfectly competent to recognize
	vice, but infinitely preferring to smile
	at honest gayety, and find out what this
	crowd really is that is again packing the
	pavement as the theaters turn out their
	audiences.</p>

	<p>Principally, so much in the majority
	as to characterize it, men of affairs,
	country merchants, out-of-town visitors,
	with and without their womenkind,
	the New York audience to whom
	actor and clergyman alike make their
	appeal; while circling about in it, embroidered
	so to speak on its surface, is
	that other crowd—high fashion, artists,
	actors, distinguished visitors, wardmen,
	Bohemians, sporting people, thieves and
	confidence men—which also produces
	its effect, and lends its coloring and vivacity
	to the picture. The side streets,
	looking east at least, are respectable,
	but they are not brilliant. Fashion, Bohemia
	and fast life are, after all, what
	we have come to watch. And as fashion
	mostly cuts Broadway—where it
	used to live and promenade when Mr.
	N. P. Willis’ natty boots pattered about
	Fourteenth Street—at the first crossing,
	it is Bohemia and the “wise push”
	we will sup with.</p>

	<p>In Broadway parlance, Bohemia
	means newspaper and theatrical people.
	And I venture to remind the ladies and
	gentlemen of the drama in presenting
	them in such a company, that I am
	painting a city nocturne, and may properly
	introduce Mr. Morgan, Mr. Beerbohm
	Tree, Father Ducey, dear man, in
	his cape overcoat, Al Smith leaning
	against the Gilsey House railing, or any
	other characteristic and familiar figure
	natural to the composition. No picture
	of Broadway would be complete, they
	will acknowledge, without them, and to
	use a metaphor I have before employed,
	they are certainly accustomed to occupy
	“the center of the stage” with
	dignity and elegance.</p>

	<p>Anyway, they all come here, and I
	should think they would all love it.
	This part of Broadway is nicknamed
	the Rialto. Nowhere else are they taken
	so cordially and frankly by the hand.
	They lounge about it by day and win
	fame and fortune in its theaters at
	night. Nat Goodwin and his wife,
	Hackett and Mary Mannering—when
	they can meet—Sir Henry Irving, De
	Wolf Hopper, Miss Annie Russell,
	bowing to Charles Richman out of a
	cab, Amelia Bingham, Joseph Jefferson,
	whose only fault is that he isn’t immortal,
	and funny, rollicking Fay Templeton,
	humming a new coon song—old
	favorites and new ones, you may
	see them going to supper at the Lambs’
	Club, the Players, the Waldorf, Delmonico’s,
	Sherry’s, any evening they
	are in town.</p>

	<p>Broadway is darker. The theater
	lights are out. Only bars and apothecaries,
	shops and hotels, are brilliant.
	The opera is over, and carriages are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"> </a>whirling away toward Fifth Avenue,
	and tramcars crawling along in procession,
	packed to the platforms with gayly
	dressed passengers. Across the way
	from Macy’s huge dark store, the <cite>Herald</cite>
	presses are rushing off the biography
	of the day in sight of everybody,
	and no philosopher moralizes on that
	awful, tremendous record of four-and-twenty
	hours of a whole world’s work,
	play, crime, suffering, heroism, love,
	faith.</p>

	<p>Our fast friends must tremble as
	they pass those windows, and remember
	the relentless, watchful eyes forever
	fixed on them. The ladies and
	gentlemen of this society dine at Shanley’s
	and Rector’s, and call supper
	<em>lunch</em>. Except that they are more
	painstakingly dressed, they don’t look
	very different from others. I have often
	thought that such a congregation
	might gather in Trinity Chapel, say,
	and be preached to by an innocent
	clergyman with a weary sense of the
	futility of trying to make such evidently
	virtuous persons penitent.</p>

	<p>Should you like to really know
	them? They are thick about you on
	every hand. Drama and tragedy and
	pathos are in rehearsal now; and that
	old comedy of “A Fool and His
	Money.” Walk a few blocks with the
	night clerk of Wilson’s chemist shop.
	Get to know the bookmaker coming out
	of George Considine’s Metropole bar,
	chat with our acquaintance, the plainclothes
	man. Join that man-about-town,
	on his way to the Astoria Club.
	Masks will be torn off then, every actor
	will be seen as he is. That family
	coachman is a burglar just out of Auburn.
	That thin, alert gentleman in
	evening clothes is a gambler, getting a
	breath of air before taking his place behind
	Daly’s wheel. That pale-faced
	student is a reporter on his way to “hit
	the pipe.” That sweet-faced girl will
	be screaming drunk by two o’clock—the
	pale little man in mourning is the
	most notorious divekeeper in America.
	The one with the beautiful silver beard
	is a race-track owner over in New
	Jersey, and they call the red-headed
	Jew talking to “Honest John Kelly”
	the king of the gold-brick men. This
	well-dressed gentleman with the large
	hands is Corbett, the pugilist; that
	kindly-faced, handsome one, going into
	Tom O’Rourke’s, is a famous all-round
	sport. Notice that beautifully gowned,
	superbly handsome brunette who is
	getting out of a hansom at Martin’s
	Restaurant. She had a yataghan in her
	flat she brought from Paris with her,
	and she caught it up one night and
	drove it into her lover’s neck, and was
	acquitted on the ground that it was done
	in self-defense.</p>

	<p>Do you want more detailed biographies,
	or is your acquaintance sufficiently
	extended? The owls on the
	<cite>Herald</cite> building are staring knowingly
	at the moon, who is coquettishly hiding
	her face behind a cloud. Mr. Greeley
	has fallen asleep in his chair, facing
	Mr. Dodge, after listening to that eternal
	long temperance speech which is
	never ended. I don’t think Broadway
	is amusing after midnight.</p>

	<p>Let’s go to Brown’s and have some
	deviled kidneys and a mug of Bass.</p>

		guided the fat

		byroad with the
		manner of a
		navigating officer
		on the bridge of a
		liner. Not even after they were straightened

		eyes from her course.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="rightcol">
		<p>“Is anything coming behind us,
		Lucy?” This to the young girl beside
		her.</p>

		<p>“No, Cousin Agatha. He kept
		straight on.”</p>

		<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

		<p>“Quite sure.”</p>

		<p>“Well, that’s a mercy.” For the first
		time she leaned back a little. “But I
		wonder that John Arnold so much as
		dreamed of trying to pass me.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

	<p>“You drive so splendidly,” replied the
	girl, drooping her pretty head so that
	the big white hat quite shaded her face.
	“The way you beat Mr. Arnold was
	fine. He looked so silly when we passed
	him. You’re so brave and—and skillful.
	It makes one feel so safe to be
	with you.”</p>

	<p>“Of course I’ve driven all my life,”
	Miss Herron admitted. “Your grand-uncle,
	the judge, my dear, always insisted
	that driving was part of a gentlewoman’s
	education, like household
	management or a knowledge of English
	history. A bit of a race is only amusing,
	but what with these automobiles,
	there’s no pleasure in horses at all
	nowadays.”</p>

	<p>“They certainly <em>are</em> dangerous.”</p>

	<p>“Dangerous! They should not be
	allowed on the roads at all. Any
	more than—than drunken men. The
	comparison somehow pleases me, Lucy.
	Did you observe it?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, yes, Cousin Agatha.” The
	girl turned to the older lady a face very
	young and fair and eyes that shone.
	“I was laughing at it all the time.”</p>

	<p>It was a great pleasure, so Miss Herron
	assured all her friends, to feel sure
	that her little cousin was for a few
	months at least to be brought under the
	influence which had shaped the lives of
	her New England forebears. For the
	child to live in Herron House, to grow
	in knowledge of her race, so splendidly
	patriotic, so consistently rich and cultivated
	from the days when Barham was
	part of a colony, seemed to the proud
	old lady a real necessity for Lucy. She
	must never forget that she was a New
	England gentlewoman; she must learn
	the traditions, stiffen with the pride of
	her race. And because these things
	might grow dim or be clean forgotten,
	did she spend all her days in the noisy,
	extravagant city or the lazy places
	abroad.</p>

	<p>Miss Herron rejoiced when Lucy’s
	father laughed, and replied to her request
	by sending the child to her for a
	whole long summer.</p>

	<p>“She is very dear to me,” he had
	whispered, looking across the room to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"> </a>where Lucy was chattering as she
	poured tea. “And very lovely, Agatha.”</p>

	<p>“She has the Herron look,” she had
	answered, complacently.</p>

	<p>“You’ll take ever so good care, of
	her?”</p>

	<p>“I may be trusted, I think, not to
	abuse any member of my family.”</p>

	<p>Quiet, sunny days followed. There
	were hours in the glowing garden,
	murmurous with bees, heavy with delicate
	perfume of box and verbena and
	mignonette; hours in the great old
	house, with its family treasures of plate
	and china and mahogany, where ancient
	Chloe and Sylvester still served as in
	the days when they had followed North
	that kindly Yankee major they had
	found helpless after the doings in the
	Shenandoah Valley. There were company
	at dinner, less formal gatherings
	on the piazza of a moonlight evening,
	when accredited youngsters from the
	summer colony amused and sometimes
	scandalized Miss Herron with their
	laughter and singing. And now and
	then Lucy would be carried off to other
	houses of Barham; whence she would
	return to render a supposedly exact account
	of all she did and said. Only
	twice since the first of June did Miss
	Herron fail in her promise to Lucy’s
	father and to herself. And these occasions
	had been within the last ten
	days, when her old neuralgia had laid
	her low. What her charge was up to at
	those times, Miss Herron did not care
	to inquire. It was ordered that not
	even Lucy should come near when
	cousin Agatha was in pain, and therefore
	uncertain in temper as well as a bit
	careless as to costume.</p>

	<p>“Tell me,” the old lady asked, after
	they had driven some distance along
	the shady road, “are you really enjoying
	your stay here?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, indeed. I think Barham’s just
	lovely.”</p>

	<p>“And what’s most lovable in it?”</p>

	<p>Lucy stole a look from under her
	broad hat brim, then retreated. “I don’t
	believe I know,” she said, simply. “It’s
	all——”</p>

	<p>“Charming. Of course. I’m glad
	you think so. We could dispense with
	the strangers, however. They don’t belong
	here. They are vulgarly rich and
	<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</em>.”</p>

	<p>“Some of them are nice, Cousin
	Agatha,” the child protested, deferentially.</p>

	<p>“Who, for instance?”</p>

	<p>“All those who come to the house.”</p>

	<p>“A pack of rascals!” the old lady replied,
	crisply. “Laughing like—hyenas,
	if that’s the animal. It’s a mercy that
	the boys and girls are sent to good
	schools. They learn some decent behavior,
	though of course they haven’t
	had your advantages, my dear. But I
	dislike their mothers. They are rich,
	but they have no poise. Poise, my dear,
	and the marks of long descent. But
	the children may develop. All but one
	of them.”</p>

	<p>Lucy’s face grew gently mutinous.
	“Which is that, cousin?”</p>

	<p>“That yellow-haired boy of——”
	She checked her reply abruptly to listen.
	The horses were reined in. “My
	dear,” she asked, resignedly, “what was
	that noise I heard?”</p>

	<p>There was no mistaking that honk of
	the goose many times strengthened,
	and, following this, the low, steady
	sputter of a gasoline engine. The nigh
	horse’s ears pricked up, then were laid
	back; his honest mate stopped short to
	await developments.</p>

	<p>“I’m afraid,” ventured Lucy, “that
	it’s an automobile.”</p>

	<p>“The wretches, to choose this road!
	Are they coming? Go along, there!”
	cried Miss Herron to the horses, who
	sprang forward as she laid the whip
	on their fat flanks. “If we can get
	just beyond the woods I can turn out
	for it. But—oh, the <em>wretches!</em>”</p>

	<p>“Honk-honk!” close behind now.</p>

	<p>“Oh!” cried Lucy. She knelt up in
	the carriage seat, looking back along
	the road.</p>

	<p>“Wave to him, my child.” Miss Herron
	leaned back on the reins. Her thin
	cheeks flushed up, and her gray eyes
	were like coal fires. “Signal the creature
	to slow up.”</p>

	<p>“I am, Cousin Agatha. I am waving
	as hard as I can.” She was standing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"> </a>now, meeting with a lithe motion of
	supple knees and slender hips each
	plunge of the hurrying carriage, one
	little hand on the back of the seat.
	And with the other, Lucy, who looked
	at cousin Agatha and then laughed—just
	a little—signaled gayly if vaguely
	to the driver of the coming car. This
	was a young man, whose hair—for he
	wore no hat—shone in the sun like crisp
	gold wire.</p>

	<p>“Honk!” spoke the horn, “honk!”
	and then three times more in quicker
	succession.</p>

	<p>Lucy laughed aloud. “Isn’t he silly?”
	And then waved once more.</p>

	<p>“Honk!”</p>

	<p>“Whoa!” commanded Miss Herron,
	drawing her steeds to the side of the
	road. “Stand still, and don’t be so
	foolish. It’s only”—she hesitated, then
	pronounced the word as though it profaned
	her speech—“an automobile.”</p>

	<p>“May I pass you?” came the driver’s
	voice from behind. The choking reek
	of the gas drifted down and enveloped
	them.</p>

	<p>“It’s all right,” caroled Lucy. “Come
	ahead!” Then she dropped down to
	her seat beside her companion, light as
	a sparrow.</p>

	<p>“Is it coming?”</p>

	<p>The horses snorted, swerved, and
	plunged heavily. There swept by a
	vision of dark green and shining brass,
	the chuck-chuck-chuck of machinery.</p>

	<p>“Oh, do be careful, Arch!” cried
	Lucy, for the ponderous machine
	ground through the soft bank that
	hemmed in the road on that side, and
	canted dangerously for a second or two.
	Then it whirled up the road, with the
	dust thick in its trail, and through the
	haze the driver’s yellow head shining.
	The fat horses shivered, and stood fast.</p>

	<p>“The wretch! I <em>knew</em> it was young
	Fraser.”</p>

	<p>“It wasn’t like him,” Lucy murmured,
	and a hint of a smile crossed
	her lips, “to have driven by us so fast.”</p>

	<p>“I’d not expect it of him, certainly.”</p>

	<p>“Nor I.” And Lucy sighed in spite
	of herself. She was not very old.</p>

	<p>“Ha!” Miss Herron bestowed a
	lightning glance on her unconscious little
	passenger, and found it her turn to
	smile, but with a kind of grimness. “Indeed!”
	she remarked, and added, under
	her breath after a queer pause: “How
	<em>very</em> extraordinary!”</p>

	<p>They drove along quietly after that
	for some minutes, for Miss Herron requested
	silence that she might compose
	herself the more readily after her
	fright. The road led them up a gentle
	incline, then turned sharp to the right,
	and a couple of hundred yards forked
	to lead around both sides of a hill. It
	was not till the horses approached this
	point that their driver opened her lips.
	She had worn, all the time that she was
	quieting her nerves, a look of anxiety
	into the midst of which would break
	every now and then the kindest and
	briefest of whimsical smiles.</p>

	<p>“Which direction shall we take?”</p>

	<p>Lucy started from her reverie. She,
	too, had said no word. “This is Steven’s
	Forks, isn’t it? Shall we go to the
	right?”</p>

	<p>“Toward home, then?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” said Lucy, eagerly, “toward
	home. To the right, please.”</p>

	<p>The talk brightened then. And Lucy
	in particular chattered away at desperate
	speed, exclaiming over the rolling
	landscape, telling her old hostess how
	much she had enjoyed Barham.</p>

	<p>“That is very pleasant to hear,” replied
	Miss Herron, graciously enough.
	“I am only sorry that my indisposition
	last week prevented our——”</p>

	<p>“Please don’t think of it, Cousin
	Agatha.”</p>

	<p>“No? My dear, have you ever been
	visited by neuralgia?”</p>

	<p>“I mean,” explained the child, eagerly
	and shyly together, “that it didn’t
	interfere with my good times at all.”</p>

	<p>“I understand. Silly girl, why don’t
	they teach you to say things properly!
	But I know exactly what you mean.”</p>

	<p>“Not <em>really!</em>” A quick dismay chased
	away the arch gayety.</p>

	<p>“And I’m very glad if you had what
	you would call a good time.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, I did! It’s all been delightful,”
	Lucy contrived to stammer, and then
	fell to scanning the road, which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"> </a>stretched away for a long half mile
	ahead of them, white and level.</p>

	<p>“A good road for those wretched
	machines,” observed Miss Herron. “I
	see one has been along it.” And she
	pointed to the track of broad tires they
	were following.</p>

	<p>“Wouldn’t a farm wagon leave those
	marks?”</p>

	<p>“Possibly, but——” She rose slightly
	in her seat, and peered ahead. She
	laughed aloud as she gathered up her
	reins and touched the horses into a
	brisk trot. “This may be the workings
	of Providence, my dear.”</p>

	<p>“Perhaps, Cousin Agatha.”</p>

	<p>“Is that thing yonder green?”</p>

	<p>“There’s only one person in it, and—and
	he’s getting out now. It’s
	stopped.”</p>

	<p>“Anything more?”</p>

	<p>“Oh!” cried Lucy, and now it was
	hers to stand, “I think——”</p>

	<p>“Indeed!” remarked Miss Herron.
	“I fancied I saw that yellow head of
	his.”</p>

	<p>“The workings of Providence!” Lucy
	sighed.</p>

	<p>“How perfectly absurd! Don’t be irreverent,
	miss.”</p>

	<p>As they approached the machine,
	young Fraser was quite invisible; but
	when at last Miss Herron had coaxed
	her horses up to it, and made them
	stand, he crawled out from beneath it
	somewhere, red-faced, dusty and with
	black grease on his hands.</p>

	<p>“The penalty of recklessness!” observed
	the old lady, surveying the boy
	as though he was inanimate stone.
	“Broken down.”</p>

	<p>“How d’ye do, Miss Herron?” said
	Fraser, apparently much embarrassed.
	“Lucy——”</p>

	<p>“Is that machine really broken?” The
	joyful hope in Miss Agatha’s voice was
	quite unconcealed. “Smashed?”</p>

	<p>“There’s something wrong, certainly,”
	the boy confessed, ruefully. His
	regard sought Lucy’s. “But just what’s
	amiss I can’t see.”</p>

	<p>The old lady shook her head warningly.
	Some outward manifestation she
	had to make in order to conceal the joy
	which, like a warm cordial, penetrated
	every fiber of her being as a certain plan
	shaped itself in her mind. This was
	the automobile which had frightened
	her horses and set her nerves twittering;
	and now it reposed by the roadside
	helpless. This was the reckless, handsome
	boy who had set her guests laughing
	on an occasion requiring a measure
	of decorum, since the bishop honored
	her house with his presence; who now,
	with every appearance of impotent anger,
	was tinkering with the vitals of a
	hot engine, dirty and perspiring. Miss
	Herron admired the idea which grew
	before her imagination as she would
	have admired a beautiful, unfolding
	flower.</p>

	<p>“It ought to go now,” the boy announced,
	after some further bungling
	examination. What his testing and poking
	was supposed to accomplish did not
	appear. He spoke with an odd ruefulness,
	and seemed to try to deepen the
	impression his tone conveyed by another
	look at Lucy eloquent of regret.</p>

	<p>“Try it,” said Miss Herron.</p>

	<p>The boy threw over the balance
	wheel; there came forth a clank and
	some faint clicks from the engine’s interior;
	then cold silence settled upon it
	again.</p>

	<p>“No go,” reported Archibald, and
	proceeded to explain what by rights
	should have come to pass. “But none
	of these engines are perfected,” he
	added.</p>

	<p>“So there you must—remain? Two
	miles from any assistance?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Miss Herron.”</p>

	<p>“I rather question the willingness of
	any of our Barham folk to aid a shipwrecked
	automobile. You drive them
	so heedlessly, young gentleman. I confess,”
	she continued, judiciously, “that
	I rather enjoy your plight.”</p>

	<p>The boy grinned delightfully. “So
	do I. It isn’t often”—how express the
	light mockery that danced on his lips!—“that
	my accidents are so charmingly
	compensated as this is.”</p>

	<p>“I am quite serious, Mr. Fraser.”</p>

	<p>“I am equally so, Miss Herron.”</p>

	<p>A moment they regarded one another
	in silence. “I am inclined to offer you
	some assistance, I think,” the old lady
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"> </a>announced, deliberately. “Merely out
	of common humanity. I have read that
	the drivers of automobiles often depend
	on friendly or highly paid wagoners
	to—to tow them. Now——”</p>

	<p>Archibald drowned the rest in thankful
	protestations. And——</p>

	<p>“It would be awfully kind of you,
	Cousin Agatha,” said little Lucy, suddenly
	finding her voice. “I’m sure that
	Archie——”</p>

	<p>“Eh?”</p>

	<p>“It would be very nice indeed,” the
	child contrived to say, and tried to look
	unconscious.</p>

	<p>“If you could help me a little,” explained
	Archibald, and his own cheeks
	flamed, though his eyes faltered not a
	bit. “The break isn’t very serious, I
	guess.”</p>

	<p>A second time Miss Herron considered
	in silence. She turned deliberately
	and looked at Lucy, who returned
	her questioning glance with a stare of
	babylike innocence; her gray eyes interrogated
	the boy.</p>

	<p>“If you can assure me that your machine
	can’t go,” said Miss Herron, “I’ll
	tow you.”</p>

	<p>For a brief second Archibald hesitated.
	Then he fumbled among the
	levers; raised the hood again; returned
	to the driver’s seat, and fingered at
	something the ladies could not see.
	“She can’t be moved,” the boy reported.</p>

	<p>From the fence along the roadside a
	loosened rail was wrenched; an honest
	cow, picketed at pasture, had her tether
	shortened a dozen feet in two strokes
	of the boy’s knife. In five minutes
	more, amid many warnings from Miss
	Herron against scratching the varnish,
	one end of the rail was made fast to
	the rear axle of the carriage, and the
	other to the automobile.</p>

	<p>“Now jump in,” ordered Lucy, radiant
	with smiles; and she pointed to
	the back seat.</p>

	<p>“Mr. Fraser,” her cousin amended,
	calmly, “will continue in his automobile.
	To—to steer, if necessary.”</p>

	<p>“But——”</p>

	<p>“I should prefer it, if you please.”
	The horses strained forward, the wheels
	turned; the triumphal procession was
	under way. “My dear,” said Miss Herron,
	“will you be good enough to hold
	your parasol over me? The sun is very
	uncomfortable.”</p>

	<p>All the way home, the length of
	Barham Street, where the people stared
	and laughed, young Fraser repeated all
	the maledictions he could remember or
	invent. For the dust choked him, and
	the view of Lucy’s back as she sat holding
	the parasol over her cousin did not
	cheer.</p>

	<p>“I’ll get even—oh, more than even!—with
	you, dear lady,” he promised, releasing
	his tiller to shake his fist at Miss
	Herron’s unconscious and unbending
	figure, “if it takes all summer. I wonder
	if she could have guessed. And it
	was planned so perfectly.”</p>

	<p>Barham laughed over the story,
	laughed again when at the Richmonds’
	dance Lucy came back into the glare
	of the lights with the Fraser boy, dazzled
	and bright-cheeked, after half an
	hour’s absence in the darkness of the
	great garden. And how many of the
	gossips would have given their ears to
	have heard the long talk between Miss
	Agatha and Lucy’s father on the night
	of his arrival? So the slow summer
	drifted by.</p>

	<p>If the Revolutionary Daughters had
	not arranged their September meeting
	on the day that a freight wreck made
	the trains from Barham westward very
	late and irregular; if Miss Herron had
	not been waiting a fretful half hour in
	the dusty station for the means of
	reaching the meeting before it was over,
	when Archie Fraser drove his car
	thither in a search for an express package,
	the latter part of this story would
	have been very different. But as the
	boy stopped his panting, throbbing machine
	at the edge of the platform, Miss
	Herron looked out the window.</p>

	<p>“I am waiting for a train,” she remarked,
	on the heels of her stiff little
	greeting, “for Oldport.”</p>

	<p>Archie glanced at the old lady’s delicate
	dress and at the badge of gold and
	enamel she wore on her breast. “The
	R. D.’s?” he asked, respectfully.</p>

	<p>“Exactly. I am one of the charter
	members, as you probably are aware.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"> </a>And to miss the meeting is distinctly
	vexatious.”</p>

	<p>“I’m so sorry.” He turned to the
	station agent. “How late’s the train?”</p>

	<p>“Half an hour or so. She won’t make
	up much comin’ this far. And she’s
	got to let the express pass her.”</p>

	<p>Out by the platform the car murmured
	its steady, quiet song of power,
	and quivered with its singing. Archibald
	started, stung by a sudden hope.
	If only——</p>

	<p>“That will bring you to Oldport very
	late, I’m afraid,” he ventured, feeling
	his way toward a compassing of his
	plan. The express package could wait.
	“I’m very sorry. I wish——” Here
	he broke off his speech to gaze pensively
	at the automobile.</p>

	<p>“It’s very annoying,” said Miss Herron.</p>

	<p>The station agent winced, as though
	she had laid a lash across his shoulders,
	and in his awkward fashion endeavored
	to apologize for his road’s remissness.
	Like a tradesman reproved by his best
	customer, he promised Miss Herron
	that “it shouldn’t happen again.” It was
	quite in keeping with her character that
	she was graciously pleased to accept
	the man’s excuses. And then the agent,
	fired into an expansive cheerfulness by
	her kindness, said that which won him
	the mysterious present he received the
	following Christmas.</p>

	<p>“Why can’t <em>you</em> take Miss Herron
	over, Mr. Fraser—hey? I guess that
	there autobile——”</p>

	<p>“That——”</p>

	<p>“Autobile,” repeated the agent, sturdily.
	“She’ll beat most o’ the trains on
	<em>this</em> road.”</p>

	<p>“The very thing!” He made a mental
	promise never to forget this man’s
	kindness and tact. “Oldport! It
	wouldn’t take us an hour; and it’s the
	best piece of road in the State.”</p>

	<p>“The idea!” exclaimed Miss Herron,
	gently scornful. “In an—automobile!”</p>

	<p>“Please come,” he begged. “It would
	be such an honor, and a pleasure, too.”</p>

	<p>“I should <em>prefer</em> the train.” But the
	very fact that she let a note of argument
	and protest come into her voice
	gave Archibald instant encouragement.</p>

	<p>The station agent, warned by a furious
	wink, came nobly to the fore. “I’m
	afraid the train ain’t goin’ to do ye
	much good, ma’am. Not for some
	time, anyway. I never see such a
	road’s this.”</p>

	<p>“I’ll go very carefully,” Archie went
	on, recklessly promising.</p>

	<p>“Of course, you know, I dislike those
	machines, but,” Miss Herron confessed,
	with a fair show of sincerity, “I am
	rather eager to be present at this meeting.”
	She surveyed with critical eye
	the deep-cushioned seats, the heavy
	springs, then the tiller and the various
	start-and-stop levers. “You think
	there’ll be no danger?”</p>

	<p>“Not the least. I’m sure you’d not
	be afraid, Miss Herron.”</p>

	<p>“I am afraid,” she replied, tartly, “of
	nothing that man can devise. Be so
	good as to lend me your arm, Mr. Fraser.”</p>

	<p>He charmed her by his deferential
	escort across the platform; he protected
	the rustling silk of her skirt from any
	possible fleck of dirt as she mounted to
	her place; he was solicitous, as a gentleman
	should be, concerning the dust
	cloth, and deft as a footman in arranging
	it. Clearly, as Miss Herron perceived,
	the boy appreciated the honor
	she was doing him, and so far earned
	her approval. Nor were his manners
	wholly uncouth.</p>

	<p>Archie drew on his gauntlets and
	settled himself, hands on tiller and
	throttle. “Are you quite ready?” He
	could not hide his smile. A sweet hour
	was to follow.</p>

	<p>“I am waiting,” she answered.</p>

	<p>“Go, then.”</p>

	<p>The ponderous machine leaped forward
	as if released from a spring, gathering
	power and speed each half second.
	Miss Herron laid her hand on the
	driver’s arm.</p>

	<p>“Not too fast—all at once,” she said.
	“I——”</p>

	<p>“She’ll do better when we strike the
	good road,” the driver replied. “This
	sand checks her badly.”</p>

	<p>It was so lovely a revenge that lay
	now in his hand to inflict. This old
	lady had towed him home once, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"> </a>laughingstock of the village; she had
	brought to naught at the same time the
	scheme which had cost Lucy and himself
	such a deal of planning. The machine
	was to be abandoned, they had
	arranged in that runaway afternoon
	when Miss Herron kept her room; the
	carriage was to overtake him in his
	distress; he was to drive home with the
	two ladies, holding Lucy’s hand on the
	back seat, and convincing Miss Herron
	of his superior qualifications to marry
	into her family. But all this had in the
	sequel come to less than nothing. It
	was Miss Herron also who, Archie was
	convinced, had been at the bottom of
	his father’s sudden determination to attach
	him to the Paris branch of the
	Fraser business, and so banish him
	from all that was dearest and best in
	the world.</p>

	<p>Now, by blessed good luck, Miss
	Herron was quite in his power to
	frighten soundly and to land at the
	gathering of the elect, blown, dusty and
	disheveled. If he had been more than
	twenty, he would have thought and
	acted otherwise than he did; but the
	likely outcome of his plan never troubled
	the boy, if indeed it entered his
	honest head at all. “I’ll scare her,” remarked
	Archie, grinning silently, “good
	and hard.”</p>

	<p>But, even as he plotted, he wooed her
	with his politest phrases; laughed, but
	not too loudly, at the little sparkles of
	wit, accepted with naïve delight her
	comments on the skill in driving that
	a boy of his age could show. For five
	minutes or so they ran quietly and
	steadily along a featureless road
	through barren pastures. There was
	time enough for his plan to blossom, for
	Oldport was nearly thirty miles away,
	and there intervened a village through
	which to drive at illegal speed.</p>

	<p>But by slow degrees, without at all
	perceiving how it came about, Archie
	found that somehow his passenger was
	a very delightful old lady. What had
	become of the absurd starchiness, which
	before had so maddened him, of the stiff
	pride, which had condescended to him
	as though Fraser &amp; Co. were creatures
	far beneath the regard of a New England
	old maid? She asked him questions,
	she was as interested as could be
	in his father’s plans for him.</p>

	<p>“Where will you live in Paris?”
	asked Miss Herron.</p>

	<p>“Oh, over in the Quarter, I hope.
	It’d be more fun there than in the other
	house.”</p>

	<p>“The other house?”</p>

	<p>“Ours, you know. Father likes to
	have his own place when he’s over.”</p>

	<p>“Indeed?”</p>

	<p>“We only lease it,” Archie explained,
	ingenuously. “It’s up near the Arch.”</p>

	<p>“Indeed! That should be extremely
	pleasant.”</p>

	<p>“I hate the idea of going,” the boy
	blurted out. He looked straight ahead;
	a slow flush darkened his fair skin.</p>

	<p>“Yes?”</p>

	<p>“Unless,” he murmured, suddenly inspired
	to madness, “unless——”</p>

	<p>Miss Herron readjusted the dust
	cloth. The boy felt a quick irritation at
	her apparent inattention; but the purpose,
	born of her apparent readiness to
	hear and approve him, held. “I want
	Lucy to go, too, Miss Herron,” he announced,
	bluntly enough.</p>

	<p>“Indeed!”</p>

	<p>“Lucy!” he cried. “I do love her so!
	Please say that I can have her. Please
	say——”</p>

	<p>“Do I understand,” she asked, and
	the boy could not comprehend why her
	old voice shook so, “that you are making
	a formal proposal for the hand of
	Miss Lucy Herron?”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” he cried, jubilantly. “Oh, say
	I may ask her.”</p>

	<p>“If you had intended so far to honor
	us,” the old lady replied, icily, “I should
	have thought that you would have approached
	the subject with <em>some</em> degree
	of formality.”</p>

	<p>“Miss Herron!”</p>

	<p>“To speak of such matters in an—automobile
	is to treat them very unbecomingly.
	It is not,” she continued,
	and all her unbending rigidity of demeanor
	was behind her words, “dignified.”</p>

	<p>“Being dignified,” cried Archie, hotly,
	“hasn’t anything to do with being in
	love.” Was it a smile that lighted up
	<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"> </a>her craggy features, like sunshine on
	granite. “You don’t understand.”</p>

	<p>“Apparently not. I am quite unused
	to the ways of modern youth. The
	world’s moved very fast in recent years.
	In an—automobile—as it were.”</p>

	<p>“But Lucy——”</p>

	<p>“Well, Mr. Fraser?”</p>

	<p>“I——”</p>

	<p>“Let us not refer to her, I beg.”</p>

	<p>“Not ever again?” he asked, but with
	no hint of disappointment.</p>

	<p>“I am surprised that you so much as
	dreamed of it under the present circumstances,”
	she replied, tartly.</p>

	<p>Archie laughed shortly. “Please forget
	that I so far forgot myself,” he
	begged. “It <em>was</em> wrong, under the
	present circumstances.” All the boy’s
	sunny malice shone from his clear eyes.
	“I ought to have remembered my real
	duty and pleasure.”</p>

	<p>“And that,” Miss Herron asked, for
	once caught unawares, as it appeared,
	“is what?”</p>

	<p>“Watch!” said Archie, briefly.</p>

	<p>They had come by now to the beginning
	of the solid macadam road that
	runs across the county, to the joy of the
	chauffeur as to the corresponding dismay
	of the truck farmers for whom it
	was constructed. There was nothing
	ahead to break the long, hard track.
	Archie reached down beside him,
	though his eyes never left his course or
	one hand the steering wheel, and set
	his hand to some lever. The song of
	the great machine was for a second
	broken; then a new song of the road began,
	louder and fiercer than the first and
	in quicker measure. Miss Herron felt
	as she did the first time she descended
	in the express elevator of a high office
	building. She was conscious that her
	hat was tugging at its pins. She settled
	herself back deeper in the seat and
	braced her feet stiffly, only to bounce up
	as they ran over some stick.</p>

	<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “Ahem!”</p>

	<p>“Sit tight,” counseled Archie, suavely.
	“We’ll get there in time, all right,
	if nothing happens.”</p>

	<p>“If anything breaks,” she remarked,
	“you can usually get somebody to tow
	the machine home.”</p>

	<p>“People are very charitable. Yes,
	Miss Herron.”</p>

	<p>“Up to a point.”</p>

	<p>And to that Archie had no rejoinder.
	It was perhaps as well that he did not
	see the smile that his passenger wore.
	It might have taken the edge off his revenge.</p>

	<p>The houses commenced to appear at
	more frequent intervals now, and took
	on a character a little different from the
	old weather-grayed dwellings of the
	open country. There showed a white,
	slim church spire above the trees.</p>

	<p>“Scarborough,” said Archie, and
	made the horn speak.</p>

	<p>“You’ll be careful?” she asked.
	“Through the village——”</p>

	<p>“Honk! honk!” This for a couple of
	children, who, starting to run across
	the road, doubled back like rabbits.
	Miss Herron caught just a glimpse of
	their white faces, and the end of their
	father’s torrent of imprecation. Now
	it was the horse of a baker’s wagon that
	climbed the bank by the roadside in two
	leaps and pranced shiveringly. Some
	boys cheered and then flung stones.</p>

	<p>“Dear me!” ejaculated Miss Herron.
	“I rather hope we’ll meet nobody I
	know.”</p>

	<p>“The sheriff himself couldn’t stop us
	now.”</p>

	<p>“But——”</p>

	<p>“Honk! honk!”</p>

	<p>“Oh, Mr. Fraser!” They missed by
	a foot a carriage that was beginning
	slowly to turn around, and was nearly
	straight across the road when Archie
	twitched the automobile aside as if it
	was a polo pony.</p>

	<p>“The stupid creatures!” cried Miss
	Herron, indignantly, when her heart
	commenced to beat again, “to block the
	way!”</p>

	<p>“That <em>was</em> a close shave,” commented
	Archie.</p>

	<p>“Not too recklessly, Mr. Fraser.”</p>

	<p>“I must get you to the meeting,
	ma’am.”</p>

	<p>“But the risk——”</p>

	<p>“If I can’t have Lucy,” the boy declared,
	sullenly, “<em>I don’t</em> care what happens.”</p>

	<p>“Assure me,” demanded his passenger,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"> </a>after a brief moment, during which
	with no slackening of speed the great
	machine tore down Scarborough’s main
	street like a green tornado, “that you
	retain entire control of the thing.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

	<p>Another pause. “I suggested that
	you make no mention of Miss Lucy.”</p>

	<p>“I can’t have her?”</p>

	<p>“How fast <em>can</em> the automobile go?”
	asked Miss Herron, ignoring the boy’s
	question.</p>

	<p>“Some faster than this. But Lucy
	can——”</p>

	<p>“Let us not discuss the matter,
	please.”</p>

	<p>“I can’t have her?”</p>

	<p>“I beg, Mr. Fraser, I <em>beg</em> you to center
	your attention on driving your machine.”</p>

	<p>“Well, I will, then. I’ll drive her,”
	said the boy, grimly, “good and fast.”
	They came again to the open, but the
	road continued hard and broad, with
	only long curves around the base of a
	hill now and then. The wind blew the
	old lady’s hair into disarray, her dress
	was gray with dust, her eyes smarted
	terribly; she gave from time to time a
	little gasp—or was it a laugh?—and
	clutched at Archie’s arm, which held
	so rigid and strong to the tiller wheel.
	“This’ll be her finish, all right,” he
	thought. “Cross old cat. Scared?” he
	asked of her.</p>

	<p>“I beg pardon?”</p>

	<p>“You’re not scared, I suppose?” he
	said, mockingly.</p>

	<p>“I have been accustomed to fast
	driving, Mr. Fraser, all my life.”</p>

	<p>It was because she made that reply
	that Archie, quite desperate by now,
	dared what finally did occur. And this
	was occasioned by his spying in the
	distance another big car headed as he
	was, but moving less rapidly. In a
	minute he was alongside, and jammed
	on the brakes. The other driver, who
	was heavily mustached, red-faced and
	had three airy young damsels stowed in
	the tonneau, looked up in surprise.</p>

	<p>“Hello, Isidore!”</p>

	<p>“Hello! Hello, Mr. Fraser!”</p>

	<p>“I’ll race you to the bridge.”</p>

	<p>“Go on, now! Watcher think I got
	here?” But the girls chorused delightedly,
	and teased their driver—all but
	one, and she leaned forward to whisper
	confidingly, with her arms around his
	fat neck. Miss Herron surveyed the
	landscape.</p>

	<p>“’Fraid cat!” giggled the girl.
	“You’re afraid, Mr. Mayer.”</p>

	<p>“I ain’t, only——”</p>

	<p>“One!” cried Archie, releasing his
	steed again. “Two!”</p>

	<p>“Leggo, May!” grunted the other.</p>

	<p>“And——”</p>

	<p>“Three!” yelled Mayer. “To the
	bridge!”</p>

	<p>By mere good luck the highway was
	empty, for to think that any cart or
	carriage could be passed was absurd.
	Side by side the huge machines, scarlet,
	green, alive with shining brass, tore
	along with the roar of express trains
	between the ditch and the bank. The
	slightest swerve at such speed meant
	death. The chatter of the careless girls
	dwindled, the faces of the rival drivers
	grew pale and tense.</p>

	<p>“Oh, be careful!” murmured Miss
	Herron. “It’s very dangerous.”</p>

	<p>“Very,” replied Archie. “Promise
	me Lucy and I’ll slow up.”</p>

	<p>A sudden little shriek of joy and
	some handclapping from Mayer’s tonneau
	interrupted what the old lady
	might have answered. Glancing over,
	Miss Herron perceived that their rival
	had drawn ahead a yard or more, that
	the girls were crying taunts at her. Not
	far away now there showed a gleam of
	the river. And then Archie encountered
	the greatest surprise of his life.</p>

	<p>“Saucy things!” remarked his passenger,
	and fell silent again.</p>

	<p>“Come on!” called the prettiest of the
	three, through her hollowed hands.
	“Old freight car!”</p>

	<p>“Archie!”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Miss Herron?”</p>

	<p>“Can’t you—— Oh!”</p>

	<p>“What, ma’am?” From the tail of
	his eye he was aware that Miss Agatha
	was wringing her hands.</p>

	<p>“Archie, they <em>mustn’t</em> beat us!”</p>

	<p>“I guess I’ll crowd him.”</p>

	<p>“Oh!”</p>

	<p>The time was ripe, he thought. “Give
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"> </a>me Lucy,” he repeated, doggedly, “or
	I’ll foul him.”</p>

	<p>He had expected to frighten her. He
	had told himself what fun it would be to
	hear her give her agitated assent, with
	the fear of death on her if she refused.
	It was to be a fine revenge. But Miss
	Herron only raised a warning forefinger.</p>

	<p>“Archie Fraser,” she said, in trembling
	tones, “if—if you take the dust
	from those common young women and
	that vulgar man, I’ll never forgive
	you.”</p>

	<p>“Great heavens, Miss Herron! I—I——”</p>

	<p>“<em>Beat ’em!</em>” she ordered truculently.</p>

	<p>He stuck blindly to his point:
	“Lucy?”</p>

	<p>“<em>Beat ’em!</em> Show me,” she declaimed,
	in trumpet tones, “that the man who
	wants to marry a Herron has some
	courage in him. Now!”</p>

	<p>The road narrowed just ahead, where
	it led through a cut in the hill and
	then down to the bridge. On either
	side the banks rose eight or ten feet,
	and very steep, and beyond was a sharp
	curve. Archie made his horn speak angrily,
	as once more he came abreast of
	his rival, favored by the fact that
	Mayer had struck a strip of newly repaired
	and soft roadway some yards
	long. A second later he was leading.</p>

	<p>“Pull up!” he bellowed hoarsely,
	crouching forward over his tiller still
	lower. He dropped his hand to the
	emergency brake. The cut was not six
	rods off. Once more the girls cried
	out, but this time in shrill fear. Miss
	Herron remained calm as the Sphinx.</p>

	<p>“Honk!” from Mayer, and the click
	of levers. His machine slid along in a
	cloud of dust. “You win!”</p>

	<p>It was ten minutes before the victors
	exchanged a single word. They rattled
	over the long bridge, steered up the
	streets of Oldport to the place where
	the Daughters were in session. Then
	Archie lay back with a sigh.</p>

	<p>“You weren’t scared a bit!” he exclaimed,
	frankly doleful.</p>

	<p>The old lady straightened her hat,
	lightly brushed off the top layer of dust
	from the front of her dress, then gave
	the briefest of queer little laughs. “It
	is one of the traits of my family,” she
	said, “never to be surprised at anything.
	And another,” she added, descending
	majestically from the automobile, “is to
	make the best of circumstances which
	appear to be inevitable.”</p>

	<p>The boy blinked. “I don’t understand,”
	he stammered.</p>

	<p>Miss Herron touched him on the arm.
	“I trust, then, that Lucy will express
	herself to you more clearly. In case—if
	you should venture to ask her a question.”</p>

	<p>And with that the old lady minced
	her way up the steps of the house to
	disappear within doors.</p>

	<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Archie, as
	the light began to break.</p>

	is to
	say, his marriage—found himself lingering
	for the purpose of basking in
	California’s smiles. The writing instinct,
	which in the little old town on
	Manhattan would keep his hand traveling
	back and forth across the paper for
	days at a stretch, here languished and
	drowsed like some heavy-eyed, faintly
	smiling lotus eater.</p>

	<p>He had, to be sure—in a spurt of energy
	that subsided almost as quickly as
	it came—begun a song to that sybaritic
	state, in which it was represented as
	a lady around whose neck hung</p>

	<blockquote>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>A chain ablaze with diamond days</p>
			<p>All on the seasons strung,</p>
		</div>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">which he thought sounded rather well.</p>

	<p>Then, unfortunately, the rains set in
	and the result was a mental washout
	that carried the last vestige of his poetical
	idea out into the vasty deep where
	individual ideas become world-thought,
	though there was a moment when he
	had an inspiration—something about
	keeping Lent, which should typify the
	rains. But this, too, drifted off like a
	chip on an ocean, and the song became
	mere literary junk.</p>

	<p>Probably the law of compensation is
	responsible for the fact that, while the
	coast’s dazzling summer is flawed by
	trade winds, its rainy season is tempered
	by mushrooms. At least, so thought
	Van Mater. Connoisseur that he was
	in the joys of living, he confessed to a
	new sensation when, for the first time,
	he found himself plodding over the
	seared, round-shouldered hills, spongy
	with the supererogatory wetness of a
	three days’ downpour. The rain had
	ceased temporarily, but the sky wore a
	look of ineffable gloom, and the feathery
	mist trailed along the earth like an
	uneasy ghost.</p>

	<p>Some swarthy, dark-eyed Portuguese
	children, met on the road the day before,
	had proffered him their pail of
	spoil, and as he examined its contents
	he understood, for the first time, what
	a mushroom really ought to be. Their
	dank odor—the odor of germinating
	things—seemed to come from down in
	the earth where the gnomes are supposed
	to foregather; and Van Mater’s
	thoughts reverted with withering scorn
	to certain woodeny, tan objects that
	had been foisted upon him from time
	to time as mushrooms—always, he now
	triumphantly recalled, to his own inward
	amazement.</p>

	<p>Why, when and where mushrooms
	had won their vogue with epicures, he
	had often dumbly wondered, though he
	had remained silent lest he expose a too
	abysmal ignorance. Now he chuckled
	hilariously. It was his acceptance of
	those frauds—those mere shells from
	which the souls had fled—that displayed
	ignorance! In future he would know
	better, and he tossed the children a
	quarter and went his way, in a pleasant
	anticipation of the manner in which he
	would carelessly throw off to certain
	admiring friends:</p>

	<p>“But I never eat mushrooms, save
	they come straight to the table from the
	soil, picked within an hour of the time
	when the rain ceases. Those things?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"> </a>Why, my dear fellow, you might as
	well eat so much gristle. Talk about
	the bouquet of wine! Why, the bouquet
	of the mushroom is as delicate and elusive
	as—as——” The simile failed to
	materialize, but he went on eloquently:
	“You can no more preserve it than you
	can the dew upon a plum.” All of
	which sounded so well that he speculated
	anxiously upon the probability of
	any of the said fellows divining how
	very little he knew about the matter, after
	all. They were so deuced knowing,
	some of them; but it seemed a pity to
	let an idea like that, what had actually
	leaped from his brain full-fledged, go
	to waste. Decidedly, it was worth the
	risk.</p>

	<p>His mind again reverted to the subject
	with pleasant anticipation when,
	the next afternoon, clad in knickers and
	a Norfolk, with a cap pulled rakishly
	over his eyes, he trudged over the hills
	to which the children had directed him.
	Soon, however, everything was blotted
	from his consciousness save a section of
	brown hill, over which his eyes roved
	eagerly in search of the small, Japanese-looking
	fungi.</p>

	<p>“Mushroom or toadstool?” was his
	stern inward query, as the pert little
	parasols became more and more numerous;
	and he did not realize that he had
	spoken aloud until a gush of laughter
	caused him to raise his eyes hastily.</p>

	<p>She was not three steps away, and
	from the trim leather leggings, above
	which her kilted skirt swirled, to the
	thick sweater and Tam that she wore,
	she seemed to Van Mater the most
	dashingly correct damsel he had ever
	seen. The foggy air had brought a
	delicious color to her cheeks and brightness
	to her eye which made her seem
	a very creature of the out-of-doors, and
	Van Mater stared, charmed and arrested.</p>

	<p>“Evidently you don’t recognize me,”
	she suggested. “I was the third bridesmaid—the
	one in pink—the homely one,
	you know.”</p>

	<p>She eyed him with a wicked satisfaction
	while the color rose to his
	face. He had a disagreeable recollection,
	since she identified herself so minutely,
	that he had rather passed that
	particular bridesmaid over with scant
	attention, amazing as it now seemed.
	Then he recovered himself, and with
	that gallant movement of the arm
	which seems the perfect expression of
	deference, removed his soft cap and
	bowed low, as he said:</p>

	<p>“Of course—I remember you perfectly
	now, Miss—ah.”</p>

	<p>He tried, as he took her extended
	hand, to mumble something unintelligible
	enough to pass for her name,
	looking at her with an admiration purposely
	open in the hope of distracting
	her attention, but the ruse was of no
	avail. She only smiled into his face
	with impish delight.</p>

	<p>“You people from the East are so
	dreadfully disingenuous,” she complained.
	“Why not confess frankly
	that, so far as you are concerned, I belong
	to the ‘no name’ series?”</p>

	<p>Her eyes were dancing, and suddenly
	Van Mater felt as if he had known
	her always—eons before he had known
	himself in his present incarnation.</p>

	<p>“To think that I shouldn’t have recognized
	you in the pink gown,” he murmured,
	with well-feigned surprise.
	“And to think that I’m no more surprised
	than I am to have you suddenly
	bob up here in the wet, after your wanderings
	of perhaps a hundred lifetimes!
	I can’t seem to recall the date and
	planet upon which we last met,” he
	continued, apologetically, “but I fancy
	that we picked mushrooms in those old
	times—that the earth and air were all
	sopping, just as they are now.”</p>

	<p>“You write books—you know you
	do!”</p>

	<p>“Well—it’s a decent enough occupation!”</p>

	<p>“Yes,” uncertainly. “Still, writers
	aren’t usually very sincere; they don’t
	mean what they say. They spin copy
	as a spider does a web!”</p>

	<p>“Writers not sincere—don’t mean
	what they say!” he echoed. “Why, my
	dear young lady, you’re all wrong.
	They usually mean so much that they
	can’t begin to say it—and as for sincerity,
	they’re the sincerest people in the
	world!”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"> </a>“That is, while it lasts!” he added to
	himself, but his listener, who had
	stooped to the ground and was now
	holding up a particularly large and <ins id="corr8" class="corr" title="lusscious">luscious</ins>
	mushroom, was all unconscious
	of his reservation.</p>

	<p>“Look out! You’re stepping on
	them!” she cried, excitedly, and for
	the next ten minutes they wandered
	about with eyes bent on the earth in fascinated
	absorption. Van Mater at last
	straightened up with such a thrill of
	satisfaction as he had not experienced
	since boyhood.</p>

	<p>“My pail’s full,” he called, seating
	himself on one of the projecting bowlders.
	“So come and show me where to
	pick the beefsteaks.”</p>

	<p>She pointed upward. Where the hill
	humped itself against the sky the
	blurred figure of a cow was visible.
	Van Mater tried again.</p>

	<p>“You might come and rest,” he
	coaxed, pointing to another bowlder that
	cropped out in friendly nearness to his
	own. With a last lingering scrutiny of
	the ground about, she came, seating
	herself beside him. Then, with her chin
	resting on her hands, she surveyed him
	with a sort of boyish <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</em>.</p>

	<p>“We’re right cozy for acquaintances
	of a half hour’s standing,” she remarked,
	at last. “But, then, I’ve heard
	about you for so long. You see, Corny
	told Beth, and she has—well—mentioned
	you to me.”</p>

	<p>“Pooh—that’s nothing! I tell you,
	I’ve known you for centuries. I remember
	that when I heard of one of
	those theosophist fellows marrying a
	girl he’d known for a thousand years or
	so, I roared. Now I understand it!”
	(Very solemnly.)</p>

	<p>She did not speak, and he began
	again with increased seriousness:</p>

	<p>“Really, I’m in earnest, you know.
	I’ve the most curious sense of—well,
	of companionship with you—as if we’d
	known each other indefinitely, as
	if——”</p>

	<p>She interrupted rather hastily.</p>

	<p>“Honestly?”</p>

	<p>Tersely—“Upon my soul.”</p>

	<p>She rose somewhat hurriedly. “It’s
	going to rain!”</p>

	<p>“Never mind. I have a conundrum.
	Why is love like a mushroom?”</p>

	<p>She wrinkled her brow. “Because
	it’s easily crushed, I suppose, and you’re
	never quite sure of it.”</p>

	<p>“Wrong. Because it springs up in a
	night—that is, in an hour,” he answered,
	impressively.</p>

	<p>The drops began to fall softly, swiftly,
	easily, as if they would never more
	be stanched.</p>

	<p>“Come,” she said, but her cheeks
	were more richly colored than before.</p>

	<p>“Isn’t this heavenly?” he murmured,
	as they vanished down the road in a
	blur of rain. She did not answer, but
	her eyes were shining.</p>

		<h2>SOME FEMININE STARS</h2>
		<p class="byline">By Alan Dale</p>
	</div>
	<p class="synopsis">Advertised personalities. Enormous sums squandered
	on theatrical impossibilities. Amelia Bingham’s
	pluck and restlessness. “Nancy Stair”
	rather tiresome. Lesser lights in star-dom.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap23.png" width="126" height="120" alt="T" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Three</span> thin, anæmic,
	bedraggled plays, each
	with a heralded, exultant
	feminine “star”
	skewered to its bloodless
	pulp, dropped into
	this metropolis just
	ahead of the reluctant crocus. Three
	highly advertised “personalities” tried
	to weather out a veritable emaciation of
	drama, and the result was, of course, a
	foregone conclusion. Slowly but surely
	is knowledge being forced upon the
	deluded manager, and he is learning to
	appreciate the vital truth of the much
	battered Shakespearian quotation, “The
	play’s the thing.” No trumped-up interest
	in one particular puppet will take
	the place of the drama itself. This is a
	pity. It is easier to create a marionette
	than it is to construct a play.</p>

	<p>The three highly advertised “personalities”
	that reached us at crocus time
	were owned and engineered by Miss
	Amelia Bingham, Miss Mary Mannering
	and Miss Virginia Harned. I mention
	them in the order in which they appeared,
	which is not necessarily that of
	superior merit. They came in at the
	fag end of a tired season, dragging a
	load of pitiful dramatic bones. Hope
	ran high, but fell in sheer despondency.
	In spite of the fact that the poet prefers
	to picture hope as springing, I
	think that in this case it may be better
	portrayed as running. There is a sensation
	of panic in the race.</p>

	<p>Miss Bingham came to town with a
	very swollen “comedy-drama,” called
	“Mademoiselle Marni,” from the pen
	of a “monsoor,” programmed as Henri
	Dumay—said to be an American “monsoor”
	at that. This actress affects
	French plays for reasons that have never
	been explained, and that certainly do
	not appear. As a “star,” she is of
	course entitled to treat herself to any
	luxury that may seem to tempt her histrionic
	appetite, and the Gallic siren
	evidently appeals to her. It is not likely
	that there will be international complications,
	although the provocation must
	at times be keen.</p>

	<p>“Mademoiselle Marni” was one of
	those impossible chromos that might
	have been designed for the mere purpose
	of giving one’s sense of humor a
	chance to ventilate itself. In the serious
	theater-goer—and one is bound to consider
	him—it awoke amazement. How
	is it that at rehearsal a dozen presumably
	sane people can “pass” such an effort,
	he must have asked himself? Why
	is it that in a theatrical venture that
	costs a great deal of money, there are
	no misgivings? The serious theater-goer
	is never able to answer these
	questions.</p>

	<p>It is almost proverbial that the most
	hopeless sort of theatrical enterprise—if
	conventional—never languishes for
	lack of funds. Try and start a solid
	business scheme, in which you can calculate
	results in black and white, and
	the difficulties and discouragements
	will be almost insuperable. Endeavor
	to obtain money for an invention or
	innovation that has success written
	across it in luminous letters, and you
	will “strike a snag,” as the rude phrase
	goes, with marvelous celerity. But a
	bad play—one that to the unsophisticated
	<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"> </a>theater-usher or to the manager’s
	scrubwoman must perforce appear as
	such—experiences no such fate. This is
	one of the marvels of theaterdom.</p>

	<p>In the case of “Mademoiselle Marni”
	Miss Bingham herself must have spent
	an enormous sum that she would probably
	have hesitated to invest in some
	enterprise sane or possible. The play
	was a turgid coagulation of illogical
	episodes lacking in all plausibility. This
	particular actress is generally happy
	when she can select for herself a character
	that is beloved by all the masculine
	members of the cast. Apparently,
	she “sees” herself in this rôle. She
	likes to appear as the personification of
	all the virtues, self-sacrificing and otherwise,
	and this idiosyncrasy is, of
	course, frequently fatal to sustained interest.
	We do not care for these sensational
	paragons.</p>

	<p>In “Mademoiselle Marni” Miss Bingham
	played the part of a very beautiful
	French actress, of whom everybody
	said: “Oh, what a woman!” (Perhaps
	the audience also echoed that phrase,
	but with quite a different significance.)
	She was exquisitely in love with <em>Comte
	Raoul de Saverne</em>, who was engaged to
	another, and was “ordered” away from
	her by the father of that other. This
	parent was a very wicked baron, and
	just as <em>Mlle. Marni</em> in an ecstasy of
	rage was about to strike him, somebody
	called out: “Do not hit him; he is your
	father.”</p>

	<p>We discovered that <em>Mlle. Marni</em> was
	the wicked baron’s illegitimate child.
	As he had been saying extremely pretty
	things to her—for she was so bee-yoo-ti-ful!—you
	will readily perceive that
	fastidious people might find this “situation”
	what some critics love to call
	“unpleasant.” Wicked barons, viewed
	in the process of admiring their own
	daughters, are not exactly long-felt
	wants upon the New York stage. However,
	this episode was scarcely offensive,
	for it was so exuberantly silly that nobody
	could take it seriously.</p>

	<p>Later on, <em>Mlle. Marni</em> gambled on the
	stock exchange, and made two million
	dollars in a few minutes, so that she
	could get even with the wicked baron,
	and force him to recall <em>Raoul</em>. In this
	act the actress wore black velvet, and
	looked every inch French—Bleecker
	Street French. It was the “big” scene,
	and was considered very strenuous by
	those acting in it. To those in the audience,
	it merely accentuated the cheap
	vulgarity of the play, that had no redeeming
	point, either literary or dramatic.
	It was, in fact, a forlorn hope.</p>

	<p>Perhaps if Miss Amelia Bingham
	would not select her own plays, she
	would fare better. She is by no means
	lacking in histrionic ability. She has
	done many good things in her day. But
	the temptation of the self-made “star”
	to see nothing but her own part in the
	drama that she buys, is very acute. A
	satisfactory <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</em>, a logical story,
	a set of plausible characters and a motive
	are all overlooked. Her own “personality”
	is her sole anxiety, and—well,
	it is not enough. Miss Bingham was
	assisted by Frederic de Belleville,
	Frazer Coulter and others less known
	to fortune and to fame, but “Mademoiselle
	Marni” was not accepted. It
	was staged “regardless,” but even that
	fact did not count in its favor. Miss
	Bingham’s pluck and recklessness were
	alone in evidence.</p>

	<p>Scarcely more felicitous was Miss
	Mary Mannering with “Nancy Stair.”
	Miss Mannering is not as good an actress
	as Miss Bingham. She is one of
	the “be-stars-quickly.” A year or two
	more in some good company would have
	been of inestimable advantage to her,
	but the lower rungs of the ladder are
	not in great demand to-day. That ladder
	is top-heavy. The upper rungs are
	worn by the futile grasp of the too ambitious;
	the lower ones are neglected.</p>

	<p>It was Paul M. Potter who tapped
	on the book cover of Elinor Macartney
	Lane’s novel, with his not very
	magic wand, and tried to coax forth
	a play. Exactly why he did this was
	not made clear, for the day of the book
	play is over, and there was nothing in
	“Nancy Stair” that overtopped the
	gently commonplace. Mr. Potter’s play
	was by no means lacking in interest,
	but we are exceedingly tired of the
	ubiquitous heroine of tawdry “romance”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"> </a>who does unsubtle things, in an unsubtle
	way, to help out certain unsubtle “complications.”
	If I mistake not, these very
	novels are beginning to pall, as such
	stupid, meaningless vaporings should
	do. One cannot resist the belief that
	one-half of them are written with an
	eye upon the gullible playwright, for a
	play means larger remuneration than
	any novel could ever hope to secure.</p>

	<p>It is not necessary to rehearse the
	story of “Nancy Stair.” I can assume
	that you have read it, though if you are
	like me, you haven’t. I look upon Mr.
	Julius Cahn’s “Official Theatrical
	Guide” as rich and racy literature compared
	with these fatiguing attempts to
	invent impossible people, and drag them
	through a jungle of impossible happenings—simply
	because Mr. Anthony
	Hope, a few years ago, achieved success
	by similar means, which at that
	time had a semblance of novelty. I may
	be “prejudiced,” but then I have at
	least the courage of my own prejudices.
	In “Nancy Stair” Mr. Potter
	even seemed to belittle opportunities
	that might have raised his play from
	the dull level of conventionality.</p>

	<p>One episode in which <em>Nancy</em>, afraid
	that her lover has murdered the <em>Duke
	of Borthwicke</em>, enters the presence of
	the corpse, and there forges a letter in
	the interests of <em>Danvers</em>, might have
	been made into something strongly
	emotional, creepy and Sarah Bernhardtian.
	This incident in itself was so
	striking, and it seemed to be so new—though
	I believe that Mr. Potter himself
	repudiates the notion that there
	can be anything new in the drama—that
	it was almost criminal to slight
	it. Nothing was made of it. It almost
	escaped attention. Instead, we got
	a crew of comic opera Scotchmen singing
	songs, and an absurd picture of
	<em>Robert Burns</em>, who was injected pell-mell
	into the “romance.” It was disheartening.</p>

	<p>Those who had read the book complained
	bitterly of the “liberties” that
	Mr. Potter had taken with it. Those
	who had not read the book complained
	equally bitterly that Mr. Potter had not
	taken more of those “liberties” and
	made it better worth his while. To me,
	the book drama is a conundrum. It
	always has been, and now that it has
	nearly died out, I am still unable to
	solve it. When you read a book, you
	form mental pictures of its characters,
	and are generally discontented with
	those that confront you on the stage.
	And when you don’t read a book, the
	play made therefrom lacks lucidity, and
	you experience the need of a “key.” I
	should imagine that the dramatization
	of a novel killed its sale. Who, after
	viewing “Nancy Stair” as a play, would
	tackle it as a novel? Of course, when
	a book is dramatized after it has had a
	stupendous sale, the author cannot complain.
	He has no excuse for protesting.
	This is a somewhat interesting topic.</p>

	<p>Miss Mannering coped with <em>Nancy</em>
	as she would cope with <em>Camille</em> or
	<em>Juliet</em>, or any character quite outside of
	her range of ability. In light comedy
	episodes, she is quite acceptable. She
	is a very pretty, graceful, distinguished
	young woman, but her “emotion” is absurd.
	Her dramatic fervor is such an
	exceedingly stereotyped affair that you
	can watch it in a detached mood. You
	can pursue your own thoughts while she
	is “fervoring,” and she will not interrupt
	them. Miss Mannering is emotional
	in a conventional stage way, and she
	knows a few tricks. But the subtlety
	that comes from experience, the quality
	that nothing but a long and arduous
	apprenticeship can produce, are leagues
	beyond her ken. It is a pity, but the
	“be-stars-quickly” all suffer in this identical
	way and there is no remedy.</p>

	<p>Robert Loraine as the “hero” gave
	a far better performance. It was theatrical,
	but satisfactory. The late <em>Robert
	Burns</em> was played by T. D. Frawley
	in a deliciously Hibernian way. Poor
	Bobbie would have had a fit if he could
	have seen his nationality juggled with
	in this manner. If Mr. Frawley had
	warbled “The Wearing o’ the Green”
	the illusion would have been complete.
	Mr. Andrew Mack could have done
	nothing better—for Ireland.</p>

	<p>“The Lady Shore” was the title of
	Miss Virginia Harned’s massive production
	at the Hudson Theater. Jane
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"> </a>Shore was dragged, willy-nilly, from
	history almost as though she were the
	heroine of a so-called popular novel,
	and two ladies, Mrs. Vance Thompson
	and Lena R. Smith, propelled her toward
	1905. While, on moral grounds,
	we may inveigh against the courtesan,
	when we meet her in everyday life, the
	fact remains that for the stage there is
	no character in greater demand by
	“star” actresses and “romantic” playwrights.
	They seem to find a peculiar
	interest in a woman who has “lived”—no
	matter how. If, in ransacking history,
	they are lucky enough to discover
	a courtesan who can be billed as a
	“king’s favorite,” they appear to smack
	their lips exultantly. One is almost inclined
	to believe that dead-and-gone
	kings must have chosen “favorites”
	merely for the sake of to-day’s stage.</p>

	<p>As soon as the playwright has excavated
	a courtesan, he begins to think
	of the best way of whitewashing her.
	For she must be offered up as more
	sinned against than sinning. Of course.
	The playwright wastes his substance
	thinking up excuses for her. He is
	quite willing—nay, anxious—that she
	shall go wrong, but he prefers that she
	shall be driven to it by untoward circumstances.
	He is desirous that we shall
	sympathize with her, to the point of
	tears, in the last act. It is very kind
	of him to do such charitable deeds in
	history’s name, and we realize how exceedingly
	unselfish he is. Just the
	same, this mania for resurrecting defunct
	courtesans seems a trifle neurasthenic.
	It appears to indicate a hysterical
	sympathy, on the part of the
	playwright, with dead characters whom,
	in life, he would hesitate at asking to
	dinner <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en famille</em>.</p>

	<p>The two women who built up “The
	Lady Shore” smashed history into
	smithereens in their rabid and frenzied
	effort to make her an exquisite impersonation
	of nearly all the virtues. It
	was, in fact, grotesque and ludicrous.
	With any old history book staring them
	in the face, they treated Jane Shore precisely
	as though she were the heroine
	of a dime novel. They had no
	qualms. They lopped great wads from
	her past, and huge excrescences from
	her present, and by the time that she
	had reached the last act, the audience
	sat dazed at the delicate beauty of her
	character. No masculine playwright
	could have done as much. Possibly if
	the purifiers of Lady Jane Shore elected
	to dramatize the career of Messalina,
	they would make of her a combination
	of Joan of Arc and Dorothy
	Vernon of Haddon Hall.</p>

	<p>The <em>Jane Shore</em> at the Hudson
	Theater was married to a brute of a
	husband, but she left him simply because
	she was driven to it, poor girl!
	She became the mistress of <em>Edward IV.</em>,
	apparently because she yearned to be
	a mother to his children. She was always
	rescuing the little princes from
	the <em>Duke of Gloucester</em>. She sat beside
	<em>Edward IV.</em>, in the council chamber
	of Westminster Palace, so that she
	could beseech him to pardon delinquents
	who were brought before him in
	a procession of fifteenth century “drunk
	and disorderly.”</p>

	<p>There never was a more perfect lady.
	The playwrights unfortunately omitted
	to picture her teaching a Sunday
	school, and I can only imagine that
	they must have forgotten to do so.
	<em>Jane Shore’s</em> love for <em>Edward IV.</em> was
	depicted in such lily tints that you simply
	hated the memory of your history
	book that said such rude things about
	her life after the sovereign’s death. The
	historical “penance” that on the stage
	seemed so effective was, as we know,
	really unavailing. Dramatic license is a
	great thing, and it is pardonable when
	it is used with discrimination. But
	made to do duty as a daub, it is unjustifiable.
	What is the use of going down
	into history as one thing, if you are to
	be bobbed up on the stage, after the
	passage of centuries, as another? To
	the feminine playwright, the line that
	separates saints from sinners is an invisible
	boundary.</p>

	<p>As a play, “The Lady Shore” was
	mere melodrama, of a somewhat incoherent
	nature. Perhaps if the central
	character had been imaginary—and it
	was nearly that—the melodrama would
	have been all the better for it. Why
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"> </a>not invent a good new character, instead
	of revamping a bad old one? Why
	not exercise the imagination upon some
	original creation, instead of straining
	it around a type that lurks in the libraries?
	The authors of “The Lady
	Shore” might have used their labors
	more advantageously. It is always a
	futile task to rewrite history. History
	is cold, and unbudgingly accurate.
	Why trifle with it?</p>

	<p>Miss Virginia Harned, however,
	escaped from her play. She is an emotional
	actress of considerable force, as
	she showed us in her production of
	“The Lady of the Camelias.” She has
	the power of repression. She is artistic,
	sincere and graceful. Her work in
	this diffuse play proved that beyond
	the peradventure of a doubt, so that her
	engagement at the Hudson Theater
	need not be unduly deplored. The
	<em>Gloucester</em> of John Blair was extremely
	amusing. Such a <em>Richard</em>, the most
	imaginative imaginer could never have
	dreamed of! He played the part as
	though the <em>Duke of Gloucester</em> were
	an Ibsen gentleman, battling with a
	dark green matinée. Mr. Loraine came
	from “Nancy Stair” to “The Lady
	Shore,” and was <em>Edward IV.</em> It would
	be interesting to know which “heroine”
	he really preferred. The little princes
	in the tower seemed to deserve their
	fate. They were arguments in favor of
	race suicide.</p>

	<p>Two other celestial bodies of the
	feminine gender, fixed for one brief
	week apiece on the theatrical “concave,”
	moved quickly in the direction of “the
	road.” These more or less heavenly
	lights were Miss Odette Tyler and Miss
	Eugenie Blair, who appeared at those
	kaleidoscopic theaters called “combination
	houses.” Miss Tyler used to be
	something of a Broadway “favorite”—a
	term that has lost a good deal of its
	significance. She appeared in the little
	Yorkville Theater on the highroad to
	One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street,
	in a play of her own, called “The Red
	Carnation.”</p>

	<p>No purpose would be served in analyzing
	this uncanny, chaotic mass, even
	were it possible to do so. Miss Tyler
	placed herself amid French revolutionary
	surroundings, and was seen as a
	remarkable “romantic” French woman,
	with a strong American accent and an
	emphatic New York manner. She fluttered
	through Paris in 1793, evidently
	convinced that it was just as “easy” as
	New York in 1905. She had a caramel
	demeanor and ice-cream allurements.
	She kittened and frivoled
	through the Reign of Terror with an
	archness that was commendable, though
	somewhat misplaced, and she let loose
	a lay figure labeled <em>Marie Antoinette</em>
	that was designed to frame her own accomplishments.</p>

	<p>Familiar as we are with the French
	revolution, used as a stage motive,
	“The Red Carnation” threw such a
	new light upon it all, that we were a
	trifle dumfounded. Miss Tyler gracefully
	revised it for us, and made it appear
	as a somewhat gay and frolicsome
	time. Moreover, it had all the modern
	improvements. It seemed to be steam-heated
	and electric-lighted, and although
	<em>Marie Antoinette</em> did not make
	her entrance in an automobile, you felt
	that it was waiting outside. Historians,
	interested in the French revolution,
	might get some valuable sidelights from
	Miss Odette Tyler’s idea of it. The actress
	herself has an agreeable personality
	and considerable ability.</p>

	<p>The other “star” to whom I have fitfully
	alluded—Miss Eugenie Blair—has
	much vogue outside of New York.
	She came to the Murray Hill Theater
	with a version of Wilkie Collins’ much-abused
	“New Magdalen,” which was
	called “Her Second Life.” This being
	her life number two, you felt a distinct
	sensation of relief that you were
	spared a glimpse at lives numbers one
	and three. It was such a very crude
	performance that I should not have
	dragged it into this record had it not
	been for the fact that Miss Blair was
	part of the singular display of celestial
	bodies that I have tried to indicate in
	this article. She is a weighty actress
	corporeally, if not artistically, and poor
	<em>Mercy Merrick</em> fared rather badly. This
	Wilkie Collins heroine has been neglected
	of late, in favor of such base subterfuges
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"> </a>as figures of the <em>Nancy Stair</em>
	caliber, but certain signs point to revivals
	of “The New Magdalen,” which as
	an emotional story has seldom been surpassed.
	Compared with the pitiful
	puppet “romances” of to-day, this
	genuine piece of throbbing fiction seems
	to be in distinctly another class.</p>

	<p>Mr. Frank Keenan, with whose
	praiseworthy effort to emulate the tactics
	of M. Antoine in Paris my readers
	are familiar, gave up the Berkeley
	Lyceum ghost, unable to weather the
	storm and stress of experiment. While
	admiring Mr. Keenan’s energy, and appreciating
	the little one-act bills that he
	offered with such rapid-transit celerity,
	it is impossible to avoid deprecating the
	lack of logical foresight that he manifested.</p>

	<p>He trifled with our young affections,
	aroused our enthusiasm and inspired in
	us the belief that a permanent institution
	was inevitable, and then—quietly
	dropped out. In other walks of life,
	people who make experiments have generally
	supplied themselves with the
	wherewithal to wait while their schemes
	approach fruition. Rome was not built
	in a day, but if the builders thereof
	had been actors, Rome never would
	have been built at all! The actor, who
	is usually a singularly unbalanced person,
	looks for immediate success, and
	can endure nothing else.</p>

	<p>Why Mr. Keenan should have expected
	to jump into a whirlwind of instantaneous
	applause is an enigma.
	Nothing that is out of the conventional
	rut succeeds at the start. There must
	be patience, perseverance and a struggle.
	Otherwise life would be very easy,
	which it is not. The rosy little scheme
	at the Berkeley Lyceum had attracted
	considerable attention. Critics paid
	homage to every change of bill, anxious
	to chronicle success, and looking with
	glad eyes at the possible advent of a
	new impetus to the jaded theatrical machine.
	They had worked themselves
	into the most appreciative state of mind.
	Lo, and behold! After a few weeks,
	M. Antoine’s American imitator evaporated.
	Lack of funds!</p>

	<p>What a dismal lack of those funds
	there must have been when the enterprise
	started! Who but an actor would
	embark upon a scheme, and project such
	radiant promises in the interests of those
	who are tired of wallowing in the
	trough of vulgar “popularity,” when it
	was apparent that, without that popularity,
	the thing couldn’t last more than
	a month? Mr. Keenan should apologize
	to M. Antoine, of Paris. He took
	his name in vain. People with new
	ideas, opposed to the conventionality
	of the old ones, expect naturally to bide
	their time before the public unhesitatingly
	accepts them. If Mr. Keenan had
	engaged in his alluring pursuit, willing
	and even anxious to “lose money”
	before he made it, a very different story
	would have been told.</p>

	<p>People ask why dramatic chroniclers
	grow cynical. The answer is simple.
	They feel that they are persistently
	“jollied” along, and they assuredly are.
	It was so in the case of the Berkeley
	Lyceum plan that fell through simply
	because money failed to pour into the
	box office, and M. Antoine, of Paris,
	lacked the vitality of Barnum &amp; Bailey’s
	circus! It was so last year when Mr.
	Sydney Rosenfeld tried to “elevate” the
	stage with the Century Players. This
	is an age of get-rich-quickly, and there
	is no other object. Actors talk of art,
	and of unconventionality; they inveigh
	against commercialism and pose most
	picturesquely. But they are in such a
	hurry to spear the florid, bloated body
	of easy success that they cannot wait.
	Mr. Frank Keenan went direct from
	M. Antoine’s Parisian plan to vaudeville!</p>

	<p>The little play upon which he relied
	to turn the tide of dollars in his direction
	was called “A Passion in a
	Suburb,” and was described as “a psychological
	study of madness,” by Algernon
	Boyesen. It was horror for the
	sake of horror, which is always distressing,
	and it was a failure. It was
	food neither for the elect nor for the
	mob. Both classes demand a plausible
	excuse for stage happenings. The picture
	of an insane husband strangling
	his wife and child might be accepted as
	the logical sequence of some startling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"> </a>train of events. But to enter a playhouse
	and watch a couple of murders
	for no other reason than that the murderer
	was a madman, is not enlivening.
	It is ghoulish.</p>

	<p>I have devoted much space to Mr.
	Frank Keenan and his plan. I was
	sorry for him until I thought it all
	over. Then I couldn’t help feeling a bit
	sore. It was all very foolish. The
	bubble was pricked so quickly! It is a
	consolation to reflect that the New York
	critics did everything in their power to
	push along a project that would have
	been of great value to this metropolis.
	It was foredoomed to failure, because it
	depended upon the iniquity known as
	“quick returns.” <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">De mortuis nil nisi
	bonum.</em> (I think I have, though!)</p>

	<p>That a one-act play is fully able to
	create a veritable sensation, as keen as
	any that a five-act drama might evoke,
	was instanced at the Manhattan Theater,
	when Mrs. Fiske produced a little
	drama, written by herself, and
	called “A Light from St. Agnes.” I
	think I may say that it was the finest
	and most artistic one-act play that I
	have ever seen—and I’ve seen a few in
	my day. It aroused a matinée audience,
	on a warm afternoon, to an ecstasy of
	enthusiastic approval, because it appealed
	directly to the artistic fiber.</p>

	<p>It was not a case for cold analytic
	judgment. It was not an occasion
	when long-haired critics could draw a
	diagram, and prate learnedly of “technique”
	and other topics that often make
	critics such insensate bores. “A Light
	from St. Agnes” was recognized intuitively
	as great. The soul of an audience
	never makes a mistake, though the brain
	frequently errs. A brain might perhaps
	prove that this play was artistically
	admirable, but the soul reached that
	conclusion instantly and unreasoningly.
	The effect was marvelous.</p>

	<p>I wonder if you quite grasp my meaning.
	You know there are some things
	that refuse to be reduced to diagram
	form. They decline to answer to the
	call of a, b and c. They won’t be x’d
	and y’d algebraically. Very material
	people of course rebel at this. They
	want everything cut and dried. They
	would dissect the soul with a scalpel,
	and reduce psychic effects to the medium
	of pounds and ounces. That is
	what certain reviewers tried to do with
	“A Light from St. Agnes.”</p>

	<p>Their material eyes saw that the end
	of the little play was murder; that its
	motive was a sacrilegious robbery—the
	theft of a diamond cross from the
	body of a woman lying dead in a
	church; that the man was a drink-besotted
	ruffian; that the woman was his
	illicit partner; that the atmosphere was
	assuredly brutal. Material eyes saw
	all this. Material senses reasoned that,
	given all these qualities, such a play
	must be horrible, and unduly strenuous.
	But intuition set all this reasoning awry.
	You see, intuition doesn’t reason; it
	<em>knows</em>. It is better to know than to
	reason. Get a dozen people to prove to
	you that “A Light from St. Agnes”
	was a dismal and unnecessary tragedy.
	Oh, they might be able to do it. Then
	go and see it, and you will understand
	precisely what I am driving at.</p>

	<p>Plays that appeal to intuition are the
	most wonderful offerings that the theater
	can make. Nothing can stay their
	effect; nobody can successfully argue
	against them. Rare indeed they are.
	When some playwright, as the result of
	a genuine emotion, makes a drama, in
	the sheer delight of that emotion, and
	with a disregard for conventionality,
	and no hope of box-office approval—then
	you get a work of art. Incidentally,
	I may remark that such a work
	of art is so irresistible that it literally
	forces the box office to tinkle. It would
	be a pity if it didn’t.</p>

	<p>The scene of “A Light from St.
	Agnes” is laid in a Louisiana village
	called Bon Hilaire. <em>Michel</em> and <em>Toinette</em>
	occupy a rude hut, in the vicinity
	of St. Agnes’ Church. The light from
	the church sometimes irradiates the sordid,
	loathsome room. In fact, <em>Toinette</em>
	places her couch in such a position that
	the light may shine upon her eyes, and
	awaken her in time to call <em>Michel</em>, her
	befuddled partner.</p>

	<p>A woman who has tried to reform
	the lawless life of this section of Louisiana
	has died. Her body lies in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"> </a>church. <em>Toinette</em> and <em>Michel</em> have both
	been cynically amused, in their reckless
	way, at her efforts, unavailing, to reform
	them. And she is dead! <em>Father
	Bertrand</em> visits <em>Toinette</em>, and tells her
	this. The peasant laughs. The priest
	gives her a crucifix that the woman left
	for her, and its influence—though the
	playwright is far too subtle even to
	suggest this—is the “moral” of the little
	play for those who want their i’s dotted
	and their t’s crossed.</p>

	<p>The drama moves quickly. The
	drama is tragedy. <em>Michel</em> returns,
	more hopelessly intoxicated than ever.
	She lies on the rude couch, seeking
	sleep. He talks, as he plies himself
	with drink. The subject is the dead
	woman in the church of St. Agnes.
	Some one had placed a lily in her hand.
	He hopes that nobody will ever dare
	to place a lily in his! There are long
	silences; significant pauses. Through
	the open window he looks into the
	church. He sees the dead woman, laid
	out on a gold-embroidered cloth. On
	her breast is a cross of diamonds.</p>

	<p>More long silences; more significant
	pauses. He must possess that diamond
	cross. Why not? He hated the dead
	woman. He would steal into the church
	and rob the body; nay, more, he would
	hurl insults at it. <em>Toinette</em> has the
	crucifix. Perhaps it is that; perhaps it
	is the awakening of some forgotten instinct
	within her. The horror of the
	man’s intention convulses her. There
	is a terrible conflict between the two.
	It is the very intensity of drama. The
	audience, wrought up, holds its breath.
	Then <em>Toinette</em>, by a ruse, escapes from
	the man, and, rushing from the dwelling,
	gives an alarm. The bells ring, in
	wildest chime. <em>Michel</em> realizes that he
	is trapped; that the woman has undone
	him. He goes after her, finds her, brings
	her back. He wrestles with her, forces
	her back upon the rude couch, and
	plunges his knife into her throat.</p>

	<p>The stage is in darkness. Yet you
	can dimly see him hovering over the
	body; you watch him in a sort of fascination,
	as he washes the blood from
	his hands, and then furtively, in the
	silence, steals away. <em>Toinette</em> lies, extended
	on the couch, motionless—dead.
	From the window the light from St.
	Agnes creeps into the room. It is cast
	tenderly over <em>Toinette’s</em> body, which it
	irradiates strangely as the curtain falls
	slowly.</p>

	<p>One must “describe” plays, even
	when in so doing one runs the risk of
	doing them an injustice. My recital of
	the story of “A Light from St. Agnes”
	sounds bald, as I recall the effect that
	the play produced. I insist that never
	for one moment was it “morbid” or
	unnecessarily horrible. It rang true,
	without one hysterical intonation. It
	was sincere, dignified, artistic, beautiful.
	It was admirably staged; it was acted
	by John Mason, William B. Mack and
	Fernanda Eliscu with exquisite appeal.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Fiske scored heavily as a playwright.
	There were two other one-act
	dramas from her pen—“The Rose”
	and “The Eyes of the Heart.” The latter
	made an excellent impression, but it
	was in “A Light from St. Agnes” that
	she stamped herself indelibly upon the
	season.</p>

		<h2>FOR BOOK LOVERS</h2>

	<p class="synopsis">Practical purposes served by stories of trade and commerce.
	Something more than entertainment. Among
	the interesting new books are “The Common Lot,” by
	Robert Herrick; “The Master Word,” by L. H. Hammond;
	“The Plum Tree,” by David Graham Phillips.</p>

	<img class="illocap" src="images/cap24.png" width="120" height="118" alt="S" /><p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Spring</span> has brought
	with it a multitude of
	gay volumes. American
	bookbinding has
	at last reached such a
	point that, whatever
	the nature of its contents,
	a novel may at least make an impression
	by its good clothes.</p>

	<p>Trade stories almost overcrowd this
	brilliant assemblage. Of course, it is
	what might be expected of American
	commercialism, that our literature
	should open its doors to all phases of
	business and manufacture. Most of us
	feel particularly at home and in our element,
	as it were, when finding amusement
	for a leisure hour among mills or
	stock markets.</p>

	<p>And these tales, like the Rollo books,
	impart much valuable information to
	the uninitiated. We can remember feeling
	a slight degree of impatience some
	years ago, when Mr. Hopkinson Smith
	gave us his careful demonstration of
	the building of stone piers in the pages
	of “Caleb West.” But in the end we
	recognized thriftily that he had given
	us, for the small price of the book,
	enough points to be available for carrying
	on an intelligent conversation with
	a stone mason; a decided addition to
	one’s accomplishments in those days of
	social misunderstanding.</p>

	<p>That book came with the first advances
	of the tide. Now hundreds of
	such volumes are washed up at our
	feet, out of which we may accumulate
	regular trade libraries if we like, from
	which a young student can learn the
	ins and outs of all professions and commercial
	ventures, their temptations or
	advantages, and their relation, as well,
	to the mysterious workings of love.
	What a possession for a would-be-well-equipped
	worldling!</p>

	<p>The only difficulty is, what are we
	going to do when these resources are
	used up?</p>

	<p>However, there is no real need to
	worry. We can still encourage the unsuccessful
	author, who has been befogged
	by romance and idealism, to peg
	away for a year or two at some, if possible,
	unique form of manufacture, going
	into it from the bottom and learning
	its tricks and its manners. He will
	have at least the opportunity of becoming
	a good mechanic, and probably some
	chance of getting up a paying novel in
	the hereafter—with a seductive cover.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>There can be no doubt that “The
	Common Lot,” by Robert Herrick,
	Macmillan Company, is among the
	strongest of this year’s books, and one
	which should take high rank as a thoroughly
	representative American novel.</p>

	<p>From beginning to end it absorbs attention,
	is virile in the depiction of
	character, and most of all notable in its
	absolute fidelity to human nature and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"> </a>the modern point of view, even where
	it points an overwhelming moral. The
	story of Jackson Powers’ career, his
	promising beginning, the natural temptation
	to overlook a bit of dishonesty,
	and his equally natural response to it,
	followed by his deterioration as an
	architect who sacrifices his ideals to
	commercial interests, is a fine piece of
	work; so is the portrait of his strong
	wife, and her slow but crushing realization
	of his weakness.</p>

	<p>The delightful little doctor in the
	slums, and the defiant product of conventionality,
	Venetia Phillips, supply
	plenty of humor, and for sensation, one
	need not look further than the thrilling
	description of the Glenmore fire, which,
	in its awful tragedy, reveals Powers to
	himself as a criminal.</p>

	<p>Not the least powerful scene is that
	in which his confession and attempts to
	atone are received by the contemptuous
	man of the world, who sees in them
	only weakness and cowardice, despite
	his scorn of the crime.</p>

	<p>No reader will put down the book
	without having experienced some stirrings
	of heart and some reminders of
	personal experience, or without a keen
	interest in the story.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>As “The Cost” dealt with finance on
	a big scale, so David Graham Phillips’
	latest book, “The Plum Tree,” Bobbs-Merrill
	Company, deals with politics on
	a big scale.</p>

	<p>In these two stories, Mr. Phillips depends
	for the success of his narrative
	rather upon theme and plot than upon
	style and characterization; not that
	these two elements are slighted, or that
	they are not skillfully and masterfully
	handled, but that one feels that they
	are purposely subordinated to the subject-matter
	and to interest in the development
	of the tale.</p>

	<p>That it is an intensely interesting
	book cannot be denied; it is so because
	it is near enough to the facts of politics
	to make the stirring and dramatic episodes
	it describes seem like the account
	of a phase of vital human life.</p>

	<p>The story is that of young Sayler’s
	development from a green, inexperienced
	and impecunious young lawyer,
	to the seasoned man who controls the
	politics of the country through his unerring
	manipulation of both party machines;
	the maker of Presidents, the
	master of Congress, the terror of the
	financial world. The methods by which
	he achieves these results make up the
	action of the story; they are such as we
	are all familiar with, except, perhaps, in
	the combination which Mr. Phillips
	makes of them.</p>

	<p>The love element is of minor importance,
	and doubtless, to some minds, it
	will be considered unattractive. But no
	one can deny that the story, as a whole,
	is one of more than ordinary power.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>The Harpers publish another new
	story by Warwick Deeping, “The Slanderers.”
	It is a novel which, in style,
	so suggests George Meredith as to
	make one suspect that the author is a
	pupil of the older writer.</p>

	<p>A pair of idealists, quite realistic,
	nevertheless, in their introduction to
	one another, and in the attachment
	which follows, are the chief actors in
	the plot. Gabriel Strong, the dreamy
	son of a prosperous English squire, falls
	in love with Joan Gildersledge, the
	equally dreamy daughter of a bestial
	and intemperate miser. Gabriel marries
	an unsatisfactory young woman in the
	vicinity, Ophelia Gusset, and retains
	Joan as his consoler and friend in a virtuous
	but high-strung companionship,
	out of which the country gossips, who
	hear of it through a spying servant, develop
	a slander.</p>

	<p>Gabriel’s wife, meantime, is amusing
	herself with a military man at a watering
	place. The clearing up of this situation,
	and the pairing off of congenial
	couples with various striking episodes,
	among them the death of Zeus Gildersledge,
	and his denunciation of his
	daughter, and the final reconciliation
	of Gabriel with his father, by whom he
	has been disinherited, make up a tale in
	which interest is sustained to the very
	end. The book is full of dainty descriptions
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"> </a>of landscape, and the few leading
	personalities are well and strongly
	drawn.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>“The Master Word,” by L. H. Hammond,
	Macmillan, is described upon the
	title-page as “a story of the South of
	to-day.” Its background is placed in
	the phosphate region of Tennessee, and
	the author assures us that many of the
	incidents described, “especially those
	more or less sensational in their nature,”
	actually occurred within her own experience.
	The purpose of the story, she
	says, furthermore, is “in full accord
	with Southern thoughts and hopes.”</p>

	<p>It is hardly necessary to say that it
	would not be a story of the South if it
	did not deal in some way with the race
	question; but it would be premature to
	conclude from this that it is essentially
	a problem novel.</p>

	<p>The opening chapters introduce this
	question, growing out of the distressing
	circumstances of a wife’s discovery of
	her husband’s infidelity, and the problem
	is interwoven closely with the plot
	in the presence of the latter’s illegitimate
	mulatto daughter. Her career and
	end are the more unpleasant to the reader
	because of the conviction that they
	are detailed with facts as they exist in
	the South. The pathetic interest of
	Viry’s story, though properly subordinate
	to the main plot, forces itself on
	the reader’s attention.</p>

	<p>In other respects, also, the truth of
	the conditions described is impressed
	upon one, even though he may be unfamiliar
	with the facts.</p>

	<p>It is a very strong tale, full of color,
	with a consistently developed plot, constructed
	with a fine sense of proportion
	and vivid characterization, except in
	one respect, which constitutes the weak
	point of the story—that is to say, the
	character of Dick Lawton, who is somewhat
	priggish and altogether disappointing.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>Miss Geraldine Bonner has very wisely
	selected a theme for her story, “The
	Pioneer,” Bobbs-Merrill Company, with
	which she is thoroughly at home. Its
	subtitle is “A Tale of Two States”—viz.:
	California and Nevada, and, therefore,
	as may be correctly inferred, it is
	a mining story, or at least a story in
	which this element plays an important
	part.</p>

	<p>The action takes place during the
	years almost immediately following the
	Civil War, and leads up to the period
	of the Bonanza discoveries in Nevada,
	in the early seventies. With such material
	as this afforded, it is easy to see
	that an extremely interesting tale can
	be constructed by so experienced an
	author as Miss Bonner.</p>

	<p>The story involves, of course, the
	consecutive gain and loss of fortunes
	many times repeated; it pictures the social
	life of San Francisco and the rough
	life of Nevada mining camps, and gives
	attractive glimpses of the valleys of California,
	all with a degree of descriptive
	power that is a little unexpected.</p>

	<p>The character of the old pioneer,
	Colonel Parrish, and the two sisters,
	June and Rosamund Allen, and the reciprocal
	affection of the three, furnish
	the large element of human interest in
	the story, for they are very attractive
	and lovable people. The relations of
	the two girls with “Uncle Jim” arrest
	the attention and stimulate the sympathies
	of the reader even more than the
	love affairs of the former.</p>

	<p>The narrative flows on pretty evenly,
	with no strikingly dramatic situations
	and no overwhelming climax, but interest
	is held tenaciously all through.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>Another of the late Guy Wetmore
	Carryl’s posthumous books is “Far
	From the Maddening Girls,” published
	by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.</p>

	<p>It is altogether a delicious piece of
	nonsense, serious neither in style nor
	intention, filled with puns so atrocious
	as to make the reader admire the author’s
	audacity, the recklessness of
	which adds much to his entertainment.</p>

	<p>A bachelor, hopelessly cynical, as he
	thinks, on the subject of women, who
	deludes himself into the conviction that
	he can successfully and permanently escape
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"> </a>from them, is not only a fair mark
	for any sort of ridicule, but also a fruitful
	theme for a farce. The particular
	bachelor who figures in this narrative
	devised a means of effecting this end
	by building himself a country house—of
	all things! The result is, of course,
	obvious; as, indeed, the result of a farce
	ought to be.</p>

	<p>Doubtless some critical souls will call
	the story flat, but to such people we
	can only say that there is a lot of harmless
	fun in the book that will act as an
	efficient corrective for jaundiced views
	of life.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>A very charming story is “The Princess
	Passes,” by C. N. and A. M. Williamson,
	the authors of “The Lightning
	Conductor,” which will be recalled with
	a great deal of pleasure by a multitude
	of novel readers. The new book is published
	by Henry Holt &amp; Co.</p>

	<p>Like “The Lightning Conductor,”
	the new book has for its theme a European
	tour, partly by automobile and
	partly on foot, undertaken by the hero,
	Lord Montagu Lane, at the urgent solicitation
	of his friends, Mr. and Mrs.
	Jack Winston, to cure a serious case of
	disappointed love.</p>

	<p>That he should find ample consolation
	for the loss of Helen Blantock, and in
	the end lose interest in her and her
	titled grocery man, will not surprise the
	reader. The manner in which it is effected,
	however, involves some rather
	unconventional details, worked out, of
	course, through the agency of a delightful
	American girl. Anyone who has
	read “The Heavenly Twins” will
	doubtless find something to stir reminiscence
	in the intercourse between Lord
	Lane and the Boy. In this the chief interest
	in the plot centers.</p>

	<p>It is altogether a charming narrative,
	full of pretty descriptive passages,
	and colored by the evident satisfaction
	the authors took in writing it.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>“The Secret Woman,” by Eden Phillpotts,
	Macmillan Company, is a little tale
	of English farm life, with a picturesque
	setting, great intensity of action and
	passion, and some indefiniteness as to
	what code of morals the rather unpleasant
	performances of its characters
	should be judged by.</p>

	<p>As adultery, usury, murder and suicide
	are among these little eccentricities,
	offset against superstition, religion and
	rationalism, the reader may take his
	choice of theories. Interest is sustained
	without question, and the two women—an
	older and a younger one—who as
	heroines and wrongdoers enlist our
	sympathy, are attractive and painted in
	clearer colors than the men. One or
	two minor personalities, however, are
	clearly drawn, and the dramatic element
	forcefully developed.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>It would be difficult to hit upon a
	novelist who shows wider divergences
	in his work than Booth Tarkington, not
	because he gives in it any special evidence
	of versatility—a word which implies
	something like genius, or at least
	talent. This peculiarity is due rather to
	an arbitrary method in the choice of
	themes.</p>

	<p>In his latest book, “In the Arena,”
	published by McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.,
	he has given a striking demonstration of
	this. It is a collection of six short
	stories, dealing with the subject of
	State and municipal politics. The question
	of cause and effect here is comparatively
	unimportant; whether Mr. Tarkington
	went to the Indiana legislature
	to get material for short stories, or
	whether he has written these because
	of his experience as an assemblyman,
	is not a matter of literary interest.</p>

	<p>The narrations are not particularly
	convincing. Those who are familiar
	with the practical politician, and his
	followers and their modern methods,
	will find few parallels in the characters
	and descriptions in these tales. Political
	bosses nowadays seldom resort to
	the crude device of ballot-box stuffing
	and threatened blackmail to defeat reformers,
	and reformers are unlikely to
	be so easily frightened as Farwell was.
	The game is much more complex than
	it used to be, principally because the reformers
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"> </a>have learned to play it more intelligently,
	and those who fail to give
	them credit for astuteness know little
	about the rules; the politicians themselves
	have ceased to make the mistake
	of underrating their antagonists.</p>

	<p>The female lobbyist is a character
	that “once-upon-a-time” flourished at
	the national and in State capitals, but
	modern methods have made her, to a
	large degree, superfluous, and now the
	high-priced lawyer, representing the
	Trust, deals directly with the party boss
	instead of the individual lawmaker. It
	is cheaper and quicker.</p>

	<p>Mr. Tarkington’s friends, Boss Gorgett
	and Mrs. Protheroe, belong to a
	species that is extinct—at any rate, outside
	of Indiana.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>“The Chronicles of Don Q,” by K.
	and Hesketh Prichard, J. B. Lippincott
	Company, is a picturesque tale of adventure,
	told, however, with a restraint
	that lends dignity and a fair degree of
	plausibility.</p>

	<p>Being the story of a Spanish bandit,
	there is, of course, an abundance of
	murder and sudden deaths; but as the
	right persons survive, and a majority of
	the villains die, with more or less violence,
	the sensibilities of the reader are
	not much shocked.</p>

	<p>In spite of Don Q’s profession and
	associates, and a temperament somewhat
	pessimistic for a highwayman, he
	is not really a bad sort of fellow. His
	idiosyncrasies are due, doubtless, to an
	early disappointment in love, on account
	of which allowances are to be made,
	particularly as he retains his courtly
	manners, a careful regard for the misfortunes
	of others, so far as his occupation
	permits, a very efficient sympathy
	with the weak and a devotion to the
	Church manifested in many practical
	ways—his piety being of the kind imitated,
	with more or less success in
	America, by persons said to belong to
	the same class as Don Q.</p>

	<p>Though apparently absolutely isolated
	from the rest of the world in his mountain
	retreat in southern Spain, he keeps
	in touch with affairs outside so far as
	they affect him, and is able, in mysterious
	ways, to anticipate, and so defeat,
	all attempts to ensnare him. Surprise
	is impossible for him, as it was for Sherlock
	Holmes.</p>

	<p>If his portrait, by Stanley Wood, is
	a faithful likeness, the influence of his
	presence is not to be wondered at.</p>

	<hr class="sword" />

	<p>“Constance Trescott,” by Dr. S.
	Weir Mitchell, Century Company,
	stands out among the stronger books
	of the season. He takes for his heroine
	a not unfamiliar type of woman, reared
	by an old uncle whose antipathy to religion
	has made her, as she describes
	it: “Neither religious nor non-religious—open-minded.”</p>

	<p>She is, however, docile because of
	her deep love for her husband, under
	the latter’s attempts to interest her in
	the faith which he holds dear. Trescott,
	who compels admiration by his
	fine, straightforward course, takes his
	wife to a small Missouri town, where
	Southern prejudice is still rife and laws
	are lax, and where feeling is bitter
	against the uncle of Constance, the absentee
	landowner, who has sent Trescott
	to represent him in enforcing evictions
	from a tract of land to which he
	claims ownership.</p>

	<p>Greyhurst is Trescott’s opponent in
	a consequent lawsuit, a picturesque and
	passionate character, with a mixture of
	Creole and Indian blood. While he admires
	Constance, he hates her husband,
	whom he labors unscrupulously to defeat.</p>

	<p>The court scene, where Constance is
	called to give certain testimony, and
	does it to the confusion of Greyhurst, is
	interesting; and still more dramatic is
	the murder of Trescott by Greyhurst,
	after the decision against the latter.</p>

	<p>The rest of the book turns upon the
	revenge which Constance, undisciplined
	as she is by nobler inspirations, devotes
	her life and fortune to wreaking upon
	Greyhurst, and its sensational consummation.
	The story is one of Dr. Mitchell’s
	most characteristic efforts, and,
	like all he writes, is well worth reading.</p>
